After Trey Kistler returned home from serving in the Gulf War, he went to work with his father building fishing rods. When his dad retired, Trey decided to blaze his own trail. He decided to make an exciting life for himself, his wife and four babies. He decided to create some solid American jobs. And he decided to try and catch as many fish as possible. So he set himself to the task of making the best bass fishing rod out there. We, and Trey, wouldn’t have it any other way. If his family name is going to be on it, it’s going to be the best. Kistler products are excellent. Period. They are the most sensitive, the most responsive, the most trustworthy. When you hold one of our rods, you know you’re holding something special.<\/p><p><strong>We. Love. Bass. And we love fishing.<\/strong> And we love the strong community that is fishing. We make rods and reels for pros, for tournament anglers, and for obsessed anglers who live to catch the most and catch the biggest, because that’s our goal, too. We don’t sit on our laurels. We are restless. There’s always a bigger fish to catch. So we push ourselves to test, innovate, and make our products and your fishing experience the very best. We build our rods in America in a small building full of new ideas and full of our Kistler family. The best design, materials, and components. The best service. The best feel and strength. Your best day on the water. As we said before, Trey wouldn’t have it any other way.<\/p>","html_content":""}},"1575395134493":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#f9f9f9","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"A Letter From Trey Kistler","content":"<p><strong>President of Kistler Custom Fishing Rods.<\/strong><\/p><p>First, thank you for checking out Kistler. We are a family centered company with endless drive to help you make the most out of every day you fish.<\/p><p>As Founder and President of Kistler, I’ve had the privilege of building and innovating fishing rods for over 28 years. I’ve learned not only the essentials of making an excellent fishing rod, but also, and most importantly, I’ve learned to stay true to our values: God, family and you, our customer. Staying true to our values has been the cornerstone of Kistler, a company obsessed with developing the most advanced bass fishing rods available.<\/p><p>I believe there is no better way to get something done than to do it yourself. Each Kistler Custom Rod is handcrafted in the USA, under our own roof.<\/p><p>We are a team and a family. When you hold a Kistler rod, you can feel the time and love that goes into each one. Innovative design, the highest quality materials and components are just a few key ingredients in our special recipe. The result? Unmatched flow, strength, and sensitivity running through each Kistler rod.<\/p><p>I’ve been a fisherman for over 40 years and have been building rods for almost 30. I know what sets a rod apart from the others. You can’t just let them run down a factory assembly line. The hands that build each rod must care - and truly know what a premium rod feels like. It’s more than a job. It’s passion that bleeds into each Kistler rod.<\/p><p>Volume is not our goal, quality is. Kistler could easily choose to have a huge warehouse full of workers, pumping out rods. But I wouldn’t feel good about putting my trusted Kistler name on rods like that. If we did it that way, you’d have your average, cookie cutter rod, mass produced with no skill, no feel, no passion or attention to detail. That’s not what I’ve chosen to do. Instead, I choose to stand behind each loyal angler that stands behind Kistler, year after year. We’ve added new, quality-ensuring steps in our build process, instead of stripping important steps out. These extra steps can been seen and felt in every cast and hook set. Taking an extra step, going the extra mile. Yes, the details matter. Our attitude is what makes Kistler a leader in the rod building industry.<\/p><p>We never bend what we stand for. We stand behind our beliefs. We are blessed and appreciate each one of our loyal customers. You allow us to do what we love every single day. Thank you for being a part of the Kistler family. One of my primary goals has always been to provide a company that people are proud to work for, and to make a product that people are proud to own. Living for others is the ultimate path to true happiness. That, and fishing. This is just how we choose to live.<\/p><p>Your fellow fisher of men, —Trey Kistler<\/p>","html_content":""}},"1583871687242":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#f9f9f9","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"","content":"","html_content":"<div id=\"video-section\"><\/div>\n<style>\n.html-content--1583871687242 {\npadding: 0px;\n}\n<\/style>"}},"1575395074808":{"type":"video","settings":{"padding":false,"title":"The Kistler Story, Pt 1","video_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/6ypCOuMMl4M","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2019-12-10_at_2.46.37_PM.png","bg_overlay_color":"#212121"}},"9555aebb-0ed2-4c1a-9b22-fd0939e03c49":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#fff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"","content":"","html_content":"<div id=\"video-section2\"><\/div>\n<style>\n.html-content--9555aebb-0ed2-4c1a-9b22-fd0939e03c49 {\npadding: 0px;\n}\n<\/style>"}},"1575395234489":{"type":"video","settings":{"padding":false,"title":"Kistler Story, Pt. 2","video_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZtKBTWqdtcQ","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2019-12-10_at_2.49.49_PM.png","bg_overlay_color":"#2c2c2c"}},"38e843f9-97da-4216-8ccf-b4c2ea551603":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#fff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"","content":"","html_content":"<div id=\"video-section3\"><\/div>\n<style>\n.html-content--38e843f9-97da-4216-8ccf-b4c2ea551603 {\npadding: 0px;\n}\n<\/style>"}},"1576011052546":{"type":"video","settings":{"padding":false,"title":"Kistler Story, Pt. 3","video_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cWF5XROUfik","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2019-12-10_at_2.51.51_PM.png","bg_overlay_color":"#313131"}},"264faf0a-ad50-426b-99d8-ef8447cd8874":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#fff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"","content":"","html_content":"<div id=\"video-section4\"><\/div>\n<style>\n.html-content--264faf0a-ad50-426b-99d8-ef8447cd8874 {\npadding: 0px;\n}\n<\/style>"}},"1576011147176":{"type":"video","settings":{"padding":false,"title":"Kistler Story, Pt. 4","video_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/UXlBkq5f2w4","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2019-12-10_at_2.53.13_PM.png","bg_overlay_color":"#202020"}},"b2788d2b-dd9e-44df-97b2-2f387b651c53":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#fff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"","content":"","html_content":"<div id=\"video-section5\"><\/div>\n<style>\n.html-content--b2788d2b-dd9e-44df-97b2-2f387b651c53 {\npadding: 0px;\n}\n<\/style>"}},"1576011247033":{"type":"video","settings":{"padding":false,"title":"Kistler Story, Pt. 5","video_url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ChrmUMm5oCk","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2019-12-10_at_2.55.07_PM.png","bg_overlay_color":"#272727"}}},"block_order":["1575394975104","c1529835-ae42-4fa1-955a-8ebd550f64cd","1575395134493","1583871687242","1575395074808","9555aebb-0ed2-4c1a-9b22-fd0939e03c49","1575395234489","38e843f9-97da-4216-8ccf-b4c2ea551603","1576011052546","264faf0a-ad50-426b-99d8-ef8447cd8874","1576011147176","b2788d2b-dd9e-44df-97b2-2f387b651c53","1576011247033"],"settings":{}},"page-about-kistler":{"type":"page-about-kistler","blocks":{"1592944092426":{"type":"hero","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Websize_Kistler_Rods_Custom_Fishing_Rods_KRmay54_copy.jpeg","header_offset":true,"text_position":"bottom-right","title":"The Way Fishing Should | Feel","link_text":"","link_url":"","text_color":"#f7f7f7"}},"1575518053459":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"Your Best Day On The Water","content":"<p>Kistler works each day so that every day you fish is your best day out on the water.

I have already told my wife she has as a Christmas present she can buy me. Another KLX rod. I bought the crankbait rod.

I have fished hundreds of tournaments with my 6'9\" micro argon and have put more fish in the livewell than any other rod I own. The sensitivity in this rod is fa beyond that of other manufacturers that are twice the price. When I did have a problem with an insert falling out of my tip eyelit, one call and not only did they send out a replacement tip, but Trey himself came on the line to help me find a rod in their new line that would have some of the same characteristics that my micro argon had. It is not every day that a company owner will take time out of his day to make sure you are buying exactly what you need. Customer service is impeccable. Thank you Trey and the entire crew at Kistler, you have a customer for life. If you are looking at getting a new rod, Kistler is miles above the rest of the pack. Best of luck and tight lines.<\/p><p><strong>Randy Marshall, TX<\/strong><\/p><p>Well I am from South Africa and got my hands on the KLX finally, the KLX 7' TCRWJ. First impressions last hey, it's just a rod that truly speaks to you when you hold it in hand...what is the KLX in my eyes? A rod that is worth way more than it actually costs...one of those freaks of nature that just exceeds at doing what it is supposed to do... I have also posed the question regarding the worthwhileness of selling two of my Steez rods to acquire two more KLX's. In terms of sensitivity there isn't too much to distinguish the two, they are so similar it's scary...BUT...what is the deciding factor? It's the way in which the KLX does this that makes it special...it's got a more forgiving tip action with enough backbone to do what you need it to do. It feels super balanced in your hand, it's super light which makes all day casting a dream...it oozes quality and also gives a exotic sense that you are holding something special. I am going to pull the trigger on two more of them...I have tried and tested them...the Zbone's are special...but other than designing your own thing that's priceless, worth more than double special? I have fished the Zbone's too...and quite frankly out of a monetary value...they aren't worth more than double...not in a worth sense but just the fact that Trey Kistler out did himself with the KLX...no one knew it would be this good...not even they did...at the price point they have revolutionized bass fishing as we know it... In monetary terms the Zbone isn't worth double the price...it's worth double the price if you want to be individual and special...the KLX is just simply miles ahead of anyone in this price bracket. It's almost too good to be true....but it really is that good...<\/p><p><strong>Emjay, Mr, Bass-Shack, South Africa<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Kistler KLX<\/strong><\/p><p>After looking at reviews on line, three years ago i decided to try the Mag series rods and loved em.

Just picked up a few of my other brand rods for comparison. Wow, what a difference in weight and overall feel! The kistlers are by far the most advanced in my book. Top of the line craftmanship and customer service make kistler #1 with me!<\/p><p><strong>kevin<\/strong><\/p><p>THIS MUST BE READ...If you own a Kistler or not...if you even fish or not...PLEASE READ. *This is an email I sent to Trey Kistler. Motivated by the great season I have had so far and how impressed I am with Kistler KLX rods...I've never had a piece of equipment (in ANY sport or activity) single-handedly incredibly improve my fishing so drastically* Mr. Kistler, As you probably know (by your UNMATCHED customer service, interest in your valued customers, and customer care) I have been a Kistler LOYAL since about 2006...Ive been loyal thru it ALL... I had 2006-2008 Kistler magnesium, Helium LTA and LTX... Even had a couple of the graphite plus blk n red rods... I remember the old blue zirconium inserts...the full handle LTA... I stayed loyal and have remained loyal thru the good and the bad...thru any problems with the 2007 n 2008 rods (although I had very little issues) and I got a whole slew of the Argon TS...and now I am so happy to see the success of the KLX line and have never been so impressed with ANY kistler line yet...AMAZING... I didn't just stay loyal using the rods, I constantly spread the word about ur rods... To the point of getting in literal arguments about Kistler..all the local BFL ABA, federation, open trail etc. anglers know me as \"the Kistler kid\" or \"the kid who has all those Kistlers\". Everywhere I go n whoever I fish with I rave about ur rods and ppl swear n joke that I'm employed by Kistler because I talk up the company so much. Nobody doesn't know what rods I fish.. Not around here. And because I tend to replace all my Kistlers every season with the newest version or line of Kistlers (replaced 2007 with 2008 LTA n mags n LTX then replaced all my mags n LTX with argon... Etc.) a couple ppl rly do think I might work for u lol. Most know that's absurd but I always try to put ur rods in other anglers hands n I've yet to have someone not blown away... I've converted many to Kistler only fisherman and gotten COUNTLESS anglers to buy at least one or a few... Ppl have thanked me personally for turning them onto Kistler... Why am I so loyal to Kistler? For one reason is because I think your Rods r top notch... I've always loved the sensitivity which is EVERYTHING TO ME in rods. Even with breakage issues I loved the way ur rods fished. Also because I recognize and appreciate (and even argue) the fact that you guys have \"invented\" or innovated SO MANY trends that r rly 'industry standard' now... (e.g. Split grip handles, no fore grip designs, \"raw\" blanks not goopy with epoxy, the amazing hook keeper, micro guides, a customizable rod on ur website, mixing cork types n looks for a 'custom look' n feel, showing rod weights on ur rods, having a Kistler direct only series to keep prices sooo low... Hand testing blanks... Even some that's not have caught on like The threads covered grips on the LTX which I loooved) not nearly enough anglers know who popularized these things. Even if you weren't the very first to ever do it, you were the first to mass produce to the public these innovations and even if that's not the case for all of the designs, you absolutely were a KEY role in making them so popular. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Well u should be very flattered. I recognize n know who's 'changed the game' in so many ways, loyal also because your openness about your Faith. I love that. No cares or worries if some won't order who have different beliefs.. You are a messenger of Jesus and it means a lot. I'm loyal because of your unbelievable customer care... To be able to call a company and have the OWNER answer is amazing.. Unheard of. Thats worth loyalty n priceless .. Thats just Some reasons why I'm loyal to Kistler always. I always will be as well... I'm so happy with the KLX rods and I'm so glad to see the success of them! I love them. You are an inspiration to keep following ur dream, stick with it thru hard times, and more proof that faith will get you through. I truly believe you will go down as a LEGEND in the rod industry like Gary Loomis... In my eyes you already are THE first class rod technician on earth... So I want you to know this, I hope you know there's so many others like me... Probably NO ONE that's been a bigger spokesperson than me on the water, on the computer, at the ramp and tournaments... Everywhere. But many who see you for the legendary rod craftsman that you are! A pillar of 'good business' as well... So plz keep this in mind and you deserve all the success coming your way! -Tanner \"Kistler Kid\" This email was Sent last Thursday night...@ 10:30 AM my time (830 in texas...right away, first thing in the morning) I received a response from Trey...it is shown below: \"Tanner, what size shirt are you? ….you fishing a tournament this weekend? You are too kind…..you made me cry….thanks. Trey Kistler\" I was blown away but not surprised @ the quick response...And the question of shirt size and about a tournament. I thought \"Wow...I write to THANK HIM and he Thanks me and wants to send me a tournament shirt?\" So I answered him and told him how amazed and impressed I am and that I was fishing that weekend...I didn't realize why he was asking until I received an email from Cindy (Kistler's amazing customer service\/orders\/does a lot woman lol) and a phone message asking me my shirt size as well...The email was an invoice...The invoice nearly made me FAINT...truly. I couldn't believe it... I am not going to specify what the invoice had...but lets just say it was so ridiculously above and beyond anything ANYONE could ever want from a company owner. It was BEYOND gracious...and It was sent OVERNIGHT delivery...with SATURDAY DELIVERY...I just can't put into words how floored I really was... I wrote him back telling him how above and beyond and unnecessary that was and how I just couldn't believe it...As always, Trey was humble and was THANKING ME...This guy's an inspiration to me as a fisherman and as a person...Because of things like THIS^...He doesn't see himself as anything more than a guy who builds fishing rods...He is an amazing person and the best business owner in the fishing industry, BAR-NONE. The package came the next day...not 24 hours after he answered me I had a package that was so amazing and gratious...And to top it off...He included a hand written letter on Kistler letterhead...personally thanking me for my Loyalty...I've told many in the last week about my experience. Many who aren't fisherman. Many who are. Not one can believe how generous and kind Trey Kistler is. I know they're all believers now. Now I share this for anyone who hasn't fished or experienced Kistler. I share it for anyone who's lost faith in people or society. Or lost faith in God. Or lost faith in Business owners...Or for anyone who is \"on the fence\" on whether or not to try a Kistler...TRY ONE. I AM SO ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE YOU WILL BE BEYOND HAPPY with your rod(s) and your experience with them. I GUARANTEE IT, FULLY. And an important disclaimer: I AM IN NO WAY, WHATSOEVER, AT ALL employed by Kistler Rods, I do not work for them in any way...I am not related to anyone that works for Kistler. This is a 100% REAL testimonial and REAL story. I also want to say that I TRULY have remained loyal to Kistler and Trey KNOWS THIS and KNOWS ME...Through many emails and orders and phone conversations (The man answers the phone at his Company...What owner could you even reach thru a phone call and waiting on the line? Or an email? Not many...and I can not name ONE that answers the phone). He is a business man who owns a business and supports a family with these incredible rods. He genuinely knows how long I've fished Kistler and I've told him every time I order how much I love the rods. So please don't think he's in the business of giving away free stuff or try to write him an email looking for a hand-out. He is the nicest person you could ever talk to but he's no fool. He sincerely wanted to THANK ME (I still can't fathom that) for my loyalty...when the loyalty was easy and I really wanted to THANK HIM for the tools he's made that have given me a \"leg-up\" on the competition...Rods that have truly been a PLEASURE to fish with...So please just know this is the type of man and company you'll be buying into with Kistler rods. They are unlike ANY OTHER...BELIEVE IN KISTLER RODS...Give them a try and it'll change your fishing. And to top it off you'll be dealing with the best customer service and customer-appreciation in the entire Fishing Industry WITHOUT A DOUBT. And you'll get the best fishing tool you can put your hands on. Bottom line is this: Kistler won't let you down, they just won't. It's not the type of company they are, It's not the type of person Trey is.

AND, if you ever had any dought about the strength and back bone of these rods, well with what I caught Saturday and this rod didn't snap, then all dought's should be put to rest.

It was fantastic. The med-heavy worm rod I used most allowed me to \"feel\" my way through grass and detect fish picking the bait up, even swimming at the boat I could feel the fish clamp down. I haven't experienced this with any other rod. I used the 7'3\" redfish special rod to throw a half ounce suspending jerk bait (which murdered them) and I could throw it a mile and still have the backbone for those long hook sets. The tip flexes perfectly for a bigger jerk bait and I didn't experience arm fatigue because of the light weight. I am not a 'window sticker' guy but I am cleaning a spot on my boats windshield to display a Kistler decal. The only one that will be on there, and damn glad I found your rods.

I had been fishing Loomis rods for about 8 years and decided to switch to the KLX and Z-Bone rods. I couldn't be happier. These rods are extremely light, perfectly balanced, and extremely sensitive. I truly believe that these rods are more sensitive than anything I have ever had. For example, I tried out my new Z-Bone's and KLX's fishing a 1\/4 oz. jig and it is amazing how sensitive the rods are. It is much easier to distinguish the bites. If you haven't tried these rods, you need too. They will blow your mind, especially the KLX. You can't beat a rod of this quality for this price. The customer service I have experienced with Kistler has been incredible. They will talk with you and not rush your decision and help you make the right choice for what you need.

I caught several fish on my new KLX cranking rod and never had a bit of trouble boating the fish after hook set, it is perfection in fish fighting.

It's actually gotten better. LISTEN TO ME: I've been a kistler-LOYAL for over 5 years now, and I absolutely love fishing and fishing equipment. I stay on top of what's new and hott and what has rave reviews...So, admittedly, throughout the years I have filtered in 1 or 2 of the year's \"hottest\" and \"best\" Non-Kistler products. Whatever rod was the \"best\" that season to compare and make sure nothing's better than a Kistler. NOTHING IS. I always found myself wanting to pick up the other brands LAST. I felt MUCH LESS confident with the other \"popular\" rods in my hands. I have and have used Magnesiums, Magnesium Micro's, Helium LTX's (no longer available), Helium LTA's, and ZBone's. I've used and sold and switched out for newer models but Helium LTA's seem to be my favorites. The bang for the buck is amazing. They fish like 400-500$ rods, honestly. The new KLX's are so intriguing though and I cannot wait to get my hands on several. A great deal and a very fair price. Great to see them competing w\/ the OH SO POPULAR 100-200$ rod market. The Carbon Steel 2013's are very intriguing too. Remember the very popular and quite nice Abu Garcia Veritas line uses 30 million modulus...the Carbons are 38 million! Find me a rod under 100$ using that! I doubt you can. Under 4 ounces too! Might be the first year I'll try Kistler's entry-level Carbon Steels. But truly, I laughed @ the old testimonials that said \"These rods make me catch more fish\"...but laugh all you want now because these rods absolutely help me catch more fish. I fish on the Northeast where deep, clear lakes are the norm' and you need to be able to fish smallmouth to win certain tournaments so sensitivity is EVERYTHING. Our fish don't spawn til Late May-June so our March and April's are colder than any month down south. Fishing in the mid to high 30's is common in March. Air and water temp. So sensitivity is the key. W\/ water that cold you may only get 5 bites a day and you better capitalize. I'm certain w\/ other rods I'd miss 3 out of 5 of those bites. I am KISTLER FOR LIFE. I've given up bothering with other rods. I feel like I'm almost getting an unfair advantage over other anglers. If you want that extra edge to help you win tournaments, have more fun, or simply catch more fish...Get a Kistler. The KLX look INCREDIBLE to me. The Helium LTA's have always been my favorite \"bang for the buck\" but I may be switching to KLX. Trust me...there's something special about these rods...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!<\/p><p><strong>Tanner Paulini, NOTHING COMPARES, Southeastern, Massachusetts<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Kistler Helium LTA's (08-2012 n presently using), Helium LTX's, Magnesiums and Mag Micros (2007-present).<\/strong><\/p><p>Just got to use my new KLX rod today and it is somethiing else very lite and sensitive.

As an owner of 12 Z Bones I was skeptical that I would be impressed by the KLX line. Trey proved me wrong. What a nice rod for the money. I find them suprisingly sensitive and strong. One of my favorites out of the line is the 7'3\" H ... great for jigs, swimbaits like the Big EZ , Frogs in heavy cover... you get alot more with the KLX. I now have 4 of the KLX rods and all arrived in perfect condition protected by Kistler's PVC tubes. all the builds were neat and clean... not one guide had excess epoxy, all rods perfectly straight and actions appropriately labelled... consistant with all Kistler products. For me, it was not a leap of faith to buy sight unseen... after all my great experiences over the years. John T Jacksonville,FL<\/p><p><strong>John Trotter, Jacksonville<\/strong><\/p><p>I first used a Kistler rod when I broke my cranking rod in an evening tournament. At that time I had a plethora of different rod manufacturers in my boat. My partner offered for me to use one of his kistlers so I put my reel on it and we went from just catching a few to winning the tournament by nearly 6 pounds. I couldn't believe how light and sensitive that rod was and it has almost stopped me from loosing fish. Since that evening I have ordered 7 Kistlers; 5 Helium LTA's, and 2 Magnesium's. 3 of the Heliums I ordered were the cranking rods; 2 of the 7'3\" and 1 7'0\". I can tell you that I am in love with the 7'3\" and just ordered another one. I can have 4 different rods tied up with crankbaits. I am contemplating pulling the trigger and ordering a Z-Bone or 2 in the spring. My favorite jig rod is an old Argon that I bought from my buddy, I still love that one but just ordered a new Helium to try. I also have one of the Magnesium spinning rod that I love and just ordered a Helium drop shot to try. I can't wait till I get to use that one. I hope to be able to write and tell you that I won alot of tournaments this year. These are definitely the best rods that I have ever used and recommend them to everyone I know or talk to about fishing!!<\/p><p><strong>Dana Brown, Tournament Director, B.A.S.S.

Dave Summers<\/p><p><strong>Dave Summers, Tracy, CA<\/strong><\/p><p>I first heard of Kistler rods after a friend won one at a local tournament. I liked the look and feel of the rod so I went to the website and found they had a BOGO special so I ordered a couple. I received the rods in a few days and was so impressed with the construction and feel that I immediately placed another order before the special expired. After 6-7 weeks usage I had some minor issues with a couple of the rods so I contacted Kistler via email explaining the issues. That very same day I received a response from Trey apologizing for the inconvenience and informing me that 2 new replacement rods where already in transit. I received the replacements in time for a tournament that weekend and have had no complaints since...in fact I just placed my order for 2 more. This kind of personalized customer service is hard to find these days and the product quality is really good. I would recommend Kistler rods to anyone and if you're skeptical I would suggest you do what I did and take advantage of one of the frequent BOGO specials and see for yourself. The product quality speaks for itself but the customer service puts Kistler over the top. Good job Trey and Co.<\/p><p><strong>Dave Walton, North Carolina<\/strong><\/p><p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.raleighbassanglers.net\/index.html\" title=\"author's website\">http:\/\/www.raleighbassanglers.net\/index.html<\/a><\/p><p>As a tournament angler i need a stick that performs day in and day out on tour.

It was a twenty-five to thirty minute battle on Trinity Bay during which we were following the fish in the boat to prevent loss of all the Garcia 4600’s 12# line. The fish took near all the line on four different runs. I decided to break the line, by this time I knew what kind the fish I had hooked, and wanted to continue fishing for Trout and Reds. I increased the drag on the reel to maximum, and pulled as hard as I could for several minutes bending the rod to extreme distortions. I thought it should have broken, but that did not happen. I landed the fish.

I have used them all but it has been narrowed down to 1, KISTLER!! I will be brutally honest and say that when I had to sell my St. Croix Legend and convert over to \"a\" KISTLER I was nearly in tears. I promise to you that I lost sleep over that decision . . . UNTIL, I purchased the new ZBone Shakey Head spinning rod! If you closed your eyes and I set the rod in your hand you would have trouble telling me when I put the rod in your hand, it is soooo lite AND sensitive! I have been \"converted\" now almost 2 months. I sold my St. Croix's, Abu Garcia's, Loomis' and already have 10 complete KISTLER combos including the ZBones, Magnesiums and Heliums. I promise to you a few weeks ago I pulled up to a point and slammed 45-55lbs, 9 fish (LMB) in 90 minutes with my new 7'4\" Magnesium Spinning rod!! Was it just coincidence that I had the best day of bassfishing in my 20+ years of doing this . . . I think not, KISTLER gets the credit. Then, I purchased the new HELIUM Dropshot rod and just yesterday I pulled up to a spot and dropped the line and hit 3 fish in about 20 minutes. Again, no coincidence, in my opinion.

I thought that not getting some fish turned in the grass was just something I was going to have to deal with I thought all the missed fish was just part of the game. After talking to Trey who is super easy to deal with i got my first z bone I personally beleive this is the best rod money can buy do your self a favor and try one they are worth the money. I now have a very high catch percentage with these rods . TRY THEM<\/p><p><strong>Matt Murphy, Moncks corner SC<\/strong><\/p><p>Trey Kistler and the gang has topped the fishing world with the z bone. I have fished tournaments for over 20 years and have fished with probably every rod company out there and at that time I thought that their rods were the best. But then I started fishing with the z bone and I can honestly say, this is the greatest rod that I have ever put into my hands. They are so light and so sensitive that it's almost unbelievable. Since I started fishing with the z bone my catch ratio has gone up over 90% and I'm thinking the fish are just biting better in my area, wrong, it is because of the z bone. To prove to myself that it was the z bone and not just the fishing is better, I have on several occasions went out and used another brand rod and fished for half a day and the other half a day with the z bone. It didn't matter if it was the morning half or the afternoon half, the z bone caught 3 times more fish than brand x. The z bone has me fishing more tournaments now than ever before and fishing with great confidence, and have picked up a little change on the way. The build your own rod that Kistler has is the greatest tool that I have ever seen. You can get the length you want, the handle you want and don't forget about the new fugi tangle free micro guides (any way you want it). SO, if you want to fish with the greatest rod on the market and win more money, go to Kistler's web site and build you a z bone to your own specifications, you will be amazed and put money in the bank.<\/p><p><strong>Ray Long<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Kistler Z Bone LE<\/strong><\/p><p>In April of this year I went to Lake Mitchell in Alabama to compete for the State Championship.

Started both tournaments using my MH 6'9 all purpose micro mag throwing top water plugs with much success I landed every fish that hammered the plug, just never had the big bite! As the days went on the bite got tougher so I switched to my 7' MH micro mag spinning rod with a drop shot, in doing this I was able to finish out my limit on what turned out to be some very finicky bass. Since the micro mags have such a high sensitivity level I could confidently feel every bite! And I was fishing on a high current river system where the bait was bouncing off the bottom constantly in contact with structure, but because of these rods I could determine what was a bite. If you are new to kistler rods and have'nt tried them now is the time! I have first hand watched these rods help me and my son put more fish in my boat day in and day out!

To keep my sanity from not working full-time, I decided to work part-time in the fishing department of Bass Pro and fish on my days off. I made, like everyone else, my share of product purchase mistakes thinking that each time I moved up in price I was getting a better rod. Not necessarilly the case. I kept buying and selling my equipment looking for the best sensitive rod I could find to up my game. I thought I'd found it when I started fishing Duckett rods, but \"NO\", I had to try a Kistler rod that one of my friends had. The Kistler I fished with that day was twice as sensitive as the Duckett rods I owned. So guess what? I promptly sold my Duckett's, bit the bullet and bought my first Z-bone 7ft Med\/Hvy casting rod. I swear, my catch rate has gone up at least 60%. I started thinking, what difference does it make what other brands are out there with big names and big prices, if you can't feel the bite? Do any of you know how many fish your missing with that other stuff you fish with? I'm a certified believer, and my search is over for the ultimate in fishing rods, it's Kistler Z-bones for me from here on out. I now have two Z-bones and one Micro Magnesium in my rod locker. Since purchasing these rods, I have made some real converts to Kistler rods who ride back of the boat with me fishing. I have my Kistler Z-bones set up with Shimano Core 50's, upgraded with Boca Orange Seal Ceramic bearings and Carbon Fiber Drags for the lightest rigs ever. I tell my fishing friends to put down their rod and reels and fish with one of mine for awhile or at least until they catch two or three bass. I tell em, \"Don't worry, I'm fishing with one too......No worries, just enjoy.\" After they catch a couple of bass with my Z-bones I ask them, \"Well, waddaya think?\" My responses are usually, \"OH, MY GAWD, WHAT A ROD AND REEL YOU'VE GOT THERE. WHERE DID YOU GET IT AND WHERE CAN I BUY ONE !!\" They actually hate picking up their rod and reel after I let them fish for awhile with one of mine. If you don't own a Kistler Z-Bone, I can honestly say and guarantee you, \"You're Missing Fish.\" If you want to take your fishing to the next level, sell off those rods you thought were good and buy at least one of Kistlers Z-Bones. I'm telling you, once you own and fish a Z-Bone, you'll never want to fish with anything else.<\/p><p><strong>David Roberts, Scottsdale, AZ<\/strong><\/p><p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanfishinghq.com\/\" title=\"author's website\">http:\/\/www.urbanfishinghq.com\/<\/a><\/p><p>hey guys i just wanted to let everone know how awesome kistler rods are!

There were three anglers in the boat with 8 Kistlers between us (my 3 Zbones, 2 Helium LTX II and 3 Helium LTA rods), so we had the full range of rods covered and ready for the ultimate test. These rods passed with flying colours, accounting for over 300 Barramundi in 4 full on days of fishing! We managed an impressive haul of 80 odd surface caught barramundi on the last day with my LE 4 Custom Spin stick doing the most damage. I also used my LE 4 casting stick to coax a 6 foot bull shark back to the boat that had taken a liking to my lure, but broke the line off deliberately, as a $15 lure wasn't worth as much as my hand! I use these super sensitive and unbelievably light rods in my home state of Victoria chasing our native Murray Cod and have landed one that topped the 100lb mark and measured 120cm in length... not bad for a rod rated at 10-17 lb... These rods are the best I have used so far (and I have used plenty!) and the new custom Z-bones take it to a new level.

Just received this new Alabama Rig rod and couldn't wait to get to the lake to try it. All I can say is throwing an A-rig is one of my favorite techniques, and this new 7'11\" A-rig Z-Bone makes it that much more productive! Up to this point I was throwing my Yumbrella on a Z-Bone 7'6\" LE6XH, and didn't think it could get any better than that.... Recently, I spoke to Trey about pulling the trigger on a dedicated A-rig rod: he recommended going to the 7'11\" STALARS711 because the extra 1\" length on the handle and the 5\" extra on the tip would make it easier to use all day. Trey was absolutely correct!!! I will recommend to all that are throwing an A-rig now that this IS the rod you need to be using. The sensitivity allows you to feel the swimbait tails moving, and easy to detect fish hitting your rig. Extra long casts are easily, and accurately, made all day with this set up, but I will have to make one minor adjustment though...I will have to respool completely with braid (instead of using some mono backing on the spool) because I can spool all the line off an Ardent XS1000 reel with this 7'11\" STALRS711 rod!

Thanks kistler for awesome products!<\/p><p><strong>Mike Chavers<\/strong><\/p><p>I've just got to say that the Kistler Z Bone is the greatest fishing rod that has ever been produced, ever. If you have not tried one of these rods then you are missing out on the best fishing of your life. If you love to fish and you fish often, then you owe it to yourself to get a z bone. I promise that once you try a z bone then you will never want to pick up another rod as long as you fish. The sensitivity in the z bone is so awesome that I believe you can feel everything that you bait comes in contact with. If you are fishing in 30' of water and your bait hits a blade of grass you can feel it. I now own 4 z bones and the fish bite\/catch ratio has gone up probably 80% and this is no lie. Kistler has set the bar in fishing rods with the z bone that I don't think can be raised. I'm telling you fishermen and fisherwomen, you owe it to yourself to get a z bone and I can promise, if you do then you will be z bone hooked for life.

I have had the rods for 18 months, and I thought that I would let you know what the body count is.

I just want everyone to know the troubles I have had while dealing with Kistler. I started using them about 3 years ago and liked them so much that I went on to purchase many, many more ( 30) only to find out later that they would not hold up when used on a regular daily basis. I broke a couple of them and paid the $50 pro-rated warranty charge to have them replaced. I think their rods should last forever even if they don't have a defect, they should replace them no matter how much I fish or old the rods get. All Star did the same thing to me and that's why I switched. I will never buy another Kistler rod or anything that Trey has ANYTHING to do with as long as I live and would not recommend anyone else to do business with this type of company. Now I found another rod company with a Lifetime Warranty that is willing to give me a trade in on my old Kistler rods for their new rods.

Finished second place in my last tournament and every fish was caught on my Z Bone LE spinning rod. The fish were finicky and the bite was very tough as well as the wind was kicking it up. But, I could feel every bite that I got with the sensitivity of the z bone. That makes 3 top 5 finishes in the last 3 tournaments and if I were a betting man, I would bet that it was all because I switched over to the z bone. I am feeling more bites than ever before. I am fishing the same places, the same baits, the same reels and the same lines, but before I switched over to the z bone, I was not catching near the fish that I am catching now. If you would like to start feeling more bites and catching more fish, then you have got to try one of the Kistler Z Bones, it has been proven.

I was fishing in 21 ft of water on a brush pile with a carolina rig had a 4ft leader and i felt a light bump. I set the hook and when got the fish to the boat it was only about 10 inches long, my partner ask, HOW did you feel that. I said to him we gotta get us some kistler rods.

I striped all my reels off them for cleaning and or rebuilding and in the process closely inspected all 17 of my Kistlers for damage or problems. Except for one guide that I had stepped on during the season and knocking the insert out they are in remarkable shape. They are a combination of Heliums and Magnesiums that have seen more than their share of torture. That one rod is going in for a complete micro guide upgrade but otherwise all of them are going into their 7th year of tournaments and guided trips. So add bulletproof to the list of positive things Kistlers are famous for. Thanks Trey for quality.

I won Big Fish for the Tournament and I have had nothing but good times on the water when ever I use that Rod on the Lakes or the Delta.

I had found some fish a week earlier out in the main river and Saturday morning when I walked outside the house the north wind was blowing around 25 mph and I thought to myself that there was no way that I was going to be able to sit on these fish, much less feel any bites. So we launched and I went straight to my fish and I think the wind had done got up to around 30 by then and it started raining a little. On my first cast, with my line bowed out about 10 feet I felt some of the stumps I was fishing, then I felt a little thump. I set the hook and fish on, I could not believe that I actually could feel the bite. The Z Bone LE I was using let me feel every bite that I got, even with the line bowed out over 10 feet. My trolling motor batteries were dead by lunch time from trying to hold the boat in position in the strong winds but that did not affect me feeling all the structure and all the bites. I do not believe that I would have caught these fish if I was not using my z bone, the sensitivity in these rods are just unbelievable. Kistler Rods has set the tone to a new level with the z bones.

It isn't a very common occurence in this day and age to receive an e-mail from the owner of a company thanking you for your busines. I thought I would take a few minutes to thank you for producing such an awesome line of rods and creating an awesome company to deal with. I've been using Kistler Rods for close to ten years now, they are the only rods I will own. Since I started using your rods and having success, many other members in my club decided to purchase a \"Kistler\" to try them out. To make a long story short, just about every member in my club now uses Kistler Rods to some degreee. With regards to performance, I purchased a Z-bone at the beginning of the year and it is by far the best rod I have ever fished with. I used it to finish 6th place on the co-angler side at the BASS Northern Open out of Sandusky Bay, OH, earlier this year. I was dragging a carolina rig in deep water and the sensitivity allowed me to catch most of the fish I weighed in. The bite was soft and I have no doubt that I would have missed some of those fish if it weren't for the Z-Bone. Lastly, I wanted to let you know that I just qualified for the BASS Weekend Series National Championship on Lake Santee Cooper on the boater side; I'll be heading down there in November. The consistently high performance of your rods played a big part in helping me qualify for this tournament.

I had cranked my reel drag down after about thirty minutes and I was actually trying to break the fish off. We drove the boat up to the fish. I pulled on that rod as hard as I could, and pulled the fish up and landed it. The rod was very heavily loaded, and did not break. Thanks for a great recommendation on a rod, and a great rod.

The fish was not slamming the secret baits, they were barely picking it up and we felt every bite we got both using the z bone. Hands down, these are the most sensitive rods that I have ever put into my hands. In 3 tournaments, we have had 2 top 10 finishes and 1 top 15 finish and we both agree we owe it all to our z bones.

She would see the fish hit the bait and wait to set the hook but with the action of the carbon steele the initial hit of the fish and the action of the tip the fish were already hooked.

He allowed me to use one of his prototype Zbones. From the first cast I was impressed. I launched the bait to the next county. Moments later I hooked a fish and was impressed with the power of such a super light rod. After that experience I was convinced I needed to get my own. 80 plus rods already in inventory was had to justify adding more, so I sold many of my 'nice rods'... \"better to have a few of the BEST than many of the good\"... as I justified it with myself (and wife). I placed my order for a Custom ZLE 7'3\" 4MH. After only about 6 wks I had my new rod. A thing of beauty. Paired with Revo Premier and 15lbs Fluorocarbon. First Tournament resulted in a second place finish, but was telling about this event, was: I caught fish among several other anglers who struggled to get bit. I gave my partner the exact bait, weight... even had him come the front of the boat and cast in the exact area, but he and others could not feel the \"lite bite\". I was culling while others where scratching their heads. I am wise enough to know it was not me, but the Z Bone that made the difference. So if you really want to elevate your game, or just feel that which you have not before, get a Z bone. I now have 3 Zbones and just ordered another. Stock or Custom they are worth the investment.<\/p><p><strong>John T., Jacksonville, FL<\/strong><\/p><p>I have been using Kistler Rods for about 2 years now. All I can see they are incredible .

Truely an awesome rod created by an awesome company, thanks Kistler for making fishing more fun and exciting.<\/p><p><strong>Ray Long, z<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>7'-3\" Kistler Z Bone<\/strong><\/p><p>I recently recieved my new kistler z-bone le4 mh, and WOW. This rod is light, and extremely sensitive. I fished a tournament on march 26 th, even with frezzing cold and numb hands, the bites were easily felt. I feel this rod helped with our win. I also have 2 magnesium ts rods, and a helium ltx II, and every one of these rods are great. Not only do you get a great product, the kistler staff really cares about their customers and will always help.<\/p><p><strong>Ronny DeNayer<\/strong><\/p><p>My son Josh and I would like to thank Kistler for doing it again! We ordered the new KISTLER hoodie and jersey and they are AWESOME! They really look great, feel comfortable and keep you warm on those cold mornings! My wife saw them and said I should have gotten her one also. We wil both be sporting our jerzees, hoodies and rods at the junior state championship at Lake Mitchell, Alabama on April 9th, As Josh goes to fish for a scholarship Thanks for all your quality equipment, from the AWESOME apparel we wear to the AWESOME fishing rods we fish with! May God bless!<\/p><p><strong>m<\/strong><\/p><p>I have got 3 Z-Bones recently and they are totally awsome great senaitivity. I have a LM action that I was throwing 1\/8oz shakey heads about 75 to 80 feet with little effort and this is on a casting rig. I really believe Kistler has really made some great improvements in their already good product.<\/p><p><strong>Joe Armold Lake Fork<\/strong><\/p><p>I think you make a great rod. I have a 7\" jig and toad rod. I have fished with the rod about 20 times and I really like the feel of the rod. I have recomended your rods to many people. But now I must say that the sad thing is that it broke on a hook set the other day and it is less than a year old and I am told I have to pay $70.00 more to replace the rod. I am not made of money so when I buy a rod I have to save my money to do it. I try to buy good rods and I know they are not cheap. I am very upset with having to pay $70.00 and I just don't think it makes since. If the rod was 3 or 4 years old I would understand but I am not happy with this. I will be telling everyone I know that your waranty program is not very good. I was told if the rod broke after two trips it would have been free to replace it. So that tells me that you stand behind your ros for about a week or how ever long it takes to go two times. I am sorry that you do not have a better program<\/p><p><strong>Scott Browning<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Kistler Magnesium TS Jig and Toad rod<\/strong><\/p><p>I have 4 kistler rods and love them. Wish I could afford more but too steep for my living. I was fishing a night event and one of my Kistler rods with my best fishing reels was knocked overboard and I was lost. I got out a large sinker and treble hook to retreive but to my disbelief the rod and reel were floating like a stick on the water so saved about $500 in short time. I keep trying to find them cheaper if I can and so far have found just one in yard sale. Love my Kistler rods.I am a small time fisherman but spend many hours on water bass fishing.<\/p><p><strong>David A. Cringle, Indianapolis<\/strong><\/p><p>My son is 15 and he used a KISTLER Carbon Steel rod fishing a soft plastic bait Saturday, out of the back of my boat and put on a clinic for me! The fish we were targeting would hit a fast bait but they were'nt eating it, so he slowed down with the plastic and at the first feel of anything he was setting the hook. I could still feel the fish that would hit my fast moving bait with my Magnesium, but they were not commiting. So needless to say I had to humble myself and go to fishing the plastic, I did catch fish but he culled everything I caught! Great job son! Thanks Kistler! We really enjoy using your fishing rods! God bless! Mike chavers<\/p><p><strong>mike chavers<\/strong><\/p><p>Man what a beautiful day on the water Sat. We did'nt win but we were one fish away from it. My Son put a fine 3 lber in the boat early that morning and we had our 5 fish limit by 7:30. My son said to me. Daddy I can't believe how much difference my Kistler rods make, I can really feel the fish and the bottom alot better now! Its awesome that he is 15 and understands the importance of quality equipment. The great thing is, is that you can use the rods in competition or just having a day on a lake or pond! And I firmly believe after watching my two sons consistently catch fish, that the sensitivity of these rods helps their and my catch ratio! Thanks Kistler for fine Rods! Mike, Josh and Zevin Chavers<\/p><p><strong>mike chavers<\/strong><\/p><p>Man, another beautiful day on the water. The fish bit fair not as good as practice but good enough to be right close to the money. Crankbaits were the key Saturday which is my passion and when you combine that with a kistler magnesium rod, things get exciting! The thing about it is that we were fishing shallow water and using small shallow diving square bill crankbaits and they would dig the bottom picking up straw, weeds and grasses. Well with the magnesium's action you could rip it on the retrieve and get the debris off of it, not wasting a cast having to slap it in the water or pick it off by hand and in doing this most of my bites would come from the rip. These rods are awesome! God bless! Thanks Kistler! GREAT PRODUCT! 5 STARS!<\/p><p><strong>mike chavers<\/strong><\/p><p>Another great day on the water with the first big tournament of 2011. It was 22 degrees at launch with a nice north wind. Me and my partner pull up to this creek mouth and start chunking crankbaits (after thawing out a little). We had a few short strikes but no hook ups. I pick up my z bone spinning rod and chunk it out there and can feel the wind whipping my line. I fish along and barely felt a little tap, set the hook, and, fish on. First keeper in well. Throw back out, felt something very light, set the hook, fish on - keeper number 2 in well. Partner not getting any bites. An hour goes by and the z bone has put 5 keepers in the boat. Okay, we are throwing the same baits, same line and I'm up 5 to 0. What can I say, z bone versus brand x......z bone wins yet again. I felt every little bite that I had and I know it was because of the sensitivity in my rod. Kistler has designed a world class fish catching machine in the \"Z BONE\".....I proved that Saturday.<\/p><p><strong>Ray Long<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>z bone<\/strong><\/p><p>I was introduced to the Kistler line just prior to the 2008 Bassmaster Classic. Alton Jones was giving a little talk\/demo and I was convinced to give them a try. Needless to say I was not dissappointed. The sensitivity each rod has is amazing. Three years and 13 rods later, it's Kistler or nothing. I've even gotten my nephew, HM1 Shane Gilley, hooked on Kistler's. While he was deployed I had Trey and his staff make him Z-Bone spinning rod made was he ever surprised when he got back.

Practice day today was awesome, multiple bites that were so easy to feel, I was using a carbon steel mh for worm fishing and had my magnesium on the cranking bite today. It was such a blast the fish were in bite and fight mode today when I set the hook on the plastic they were caught and all I had to do on the crankbait was just reel into them! You always have to play a fish correctly but it sure makes it easier with a rod that is designed for it's assignment. So excited about Sat. I know my KISTLERS are ready I just hope the fish are! Pics on facebook soon! Thanks again KISTLER! God bless!<\/p><p><strong>mike chavers<\/strong><\/p><p>Man I am stoked! First big tournament of the year coming up on Sat. I got the Kistlers rigged and ready to rock! See the deal with fishing with Quality KISTLER equipment is, just knowing that when you come thru or across that structure you can feel it or when that fish taps it or starts walking with it you can know it! It gives you confidence in knowing that when you swing for the hook set that its going to have resistance behind it, because you know when it's a fish! Seriously you can go back to old school fishing with a quality rod like this. You count down to the bottom, feel the bottom and then you can read the bottom with the sensitivity. I am not saying it is a depth or bottom finder but this is the way the old timers used to do it! Again Thanks Kistler for such fine quality fishing rods!<\/p><p><strong>mike chavers, Baldwin county, Al.<\/strong><\/p><p>I have been using Kistler rod for about 7 years now and I truely believe the they have turned me from a middle of the pack finisher to a threat in each of the tournements that I fish.

During Dec-Jan I was in some area club events and my 5 new Z-Bones brought it home. The custom-made 7 ft H was 100%, I mean 100% for jig bites felt and in the livewell. I like. A tough chilly early December day but 4th with 6 keepers for a 12.12# limit helped in the points race on Lake Bruin near St. Joseph, La. Then Jan. 15th I won a small closed no points event with another club on Lake Concordia near Ferriday, La. The Z-Bone ripped that 5\/0 jig hook into the daily 4.50 lunker early and despite only 1 limit my 4 keepers...10.25# was just enough for the .25 edge.

I went fishing with my Mom, Dad, and girlfriend and like all good stories this one started out kinda rough. We had just started heading up river when the motor on my Dad's boat failed. With nothing to do but float back to the boatramp I decided to pick up my 7' medium heavy carbon steel Kistler rod and try and catch a few fish. I droped a 3\/8 ounce gold spoon to the botton and bounced it twice when something huge pounded the line. The fight lasted about 15 minutes and by the end I had a 50lb flathead catfish in the boat. Your rod once again performed flawlessly. THANKS!!!!<\/p><p><strong>Darin C., Frisco TX.<\/strong><\/p><p>If you are looking for the best fishing rod money can buy LOOK NO FURTHER. If you are looking for the best value in a high end rod LOOK NO FURTHER. If you are looking for one of the lightest rods you ever had in your hand LOOK NO FURTHER. If you are looking for the most sensative rod you have ever used LOOK NO FURTHER. Read all the testamonials on the Kistler Z-Bone line of rods these are the truthful facts from everyday ordinary people using a extraordinary fishing rod made by people that want to and do produce the best fishing rods on the market. I have used many high end fishing rods over the last 20 years- G.Loomis GLX, St Croix, Powell, Power Tackle- and was constantly searching for the ultimate fishing rod and I can honestly say that I have found it. If you are on the fence about the purchase of a Z-Bone rod get off the fence and make the purchase . If there is one rod on the market that can help you become a better fisherman or fisherwoman or a better tournament angler this is the one! Powerful, light weight, extremely sensitive and the best value in a high end rod. After using my Z-Bone LE 7'6\" H at a tournament during a cold front in Florida, I am convinced that had I not been using that rod that I would have not felt most of the bites that I got that day. I am also convinced that my partner and some of the other competitors had some bites that day that they never felt . I also wonder about all the past tournaments I fished how many bites I had and never felt ? I am sure that there was many. After using the Z-Bone you will be left scratching your head also!

Charlie.<\/p><p><strong>charles librizzi, sales, adi, boynton bch florida<\/strong><\/p><p>I bought a Helium 2 LTX 6'9\" MH spinning rod and used it to throw soft plastics and jigs. The sensitvity was great but the strength of the rod is very poor. I had 3 different rods in the back of my truck with a cooler. One was my Kistler, a G Loomis IMX, and a Shimano Crucial. We were driving a little too fast down a dirt road, which was my fault, and the cooler started bouncing around. When we stopped to check the rods, only the Kistler was broken. The other 2 were fine. (This is the first time this rod broke). They sent me a replacement and for a year and a half it worked fine. Then one afternoon I was throwing a 1\/4 ounce jig. I rared back to cast it and when I started to whip it forward, it snapped in half, half way down the rod. Unbelieveable. If you are going to purchase a rod this expensive the warranty should be A LOT better than what it is. Needless to say, I WILL NOT be purchasing a $350 rod that is no stronger than that.<\/p><p><strong>Matt Eads<\/strong><\/p><p>I'm not one to jump on the bassn equipment bandwagon when it comes to rods and reels very easily.

After carefully surveying the market I chose a Kistler Micro Magnesium seven foot medium action rod. It arrived yesterday. The rod is fantastic! As far as appearance, attention to detail, and construction, it rivals most custom rods (including my own). Of course, that's not the main reason for buying any rod; fishing with it is. I tried it out today on a local lake and the level of performance is amazing. The balance, flex during casting, control, and accuracy are superb. The sensitivity of the blank allows you to feel even the lightest take, and when you have a fish on you can really feel its power and motion. It will definitely be my goto rod when I'm not fishing with a fly rod! Also, I want to thank you for including the beautiful message about our Lord Jesus Christ. I became a Christian in 1977 and my life has never been the same since. Knowing that his presence is with me and his spirit in me has allowed me to feel peace and comfort regardless of the circumstances. If only everyone would accept the gift!

I hear \"will you get this thing off here?\" It is dumping rain so I was wearing Frogtoggs. I set my kistler down and grab my pliers and head to the back of the boat. My Kistler naturally was kick in the water by my baggy pants. I reach for it but see it sinking away. I dive in head first caught the rod and never lost my hat in the process. thinking all is well i hear \"OWWWW!!! *$%@*&\" look up and here is a treble hook as deep in her thumb as ive ever seen a treble hook. She thought I fell in and took her attention away from the fish. Well an hour later we were at the dock going to the emergency room.

That ended after a week of fishing in Canada. We have fished Canada for 20 years now and the non-stop, week long experience brings you intimately familiar with your gear. There are many rods in our boat, Loomis, St Croix, Kistler’s, Shimano’s, to name a few. This year I fished a new Kistler Z-Bone, 6’ 9” LE with micro guides and revolver (Roberts) wrap. I finesse fish plastics 90 % of the time and the Z-Bone rod was superb. This extremely light, 3 power rod easily handled many Bass, Pike, and Bowfin with ease and provided a level of sensitivity that no other rod in the boat could match. Teamed with a Shimano Core MG7, spooled with Daiwa 30 lb braid and a 5ft Fluoro leader, I could feel the slightest activity at the lure. This combination is so light that after a day of fishing you feel no arm weariness at all. The Z-Bone rod was outstanding, so much so that I only fished my other rods to confirm what I was experiencing. There are a few negatives with this rod. First and least significant is trying to pass a knot through the tip with micro guides. On the cast, you don’t even know the knot is there. On the retrieve, the knot tends to hang up on the tip. This proved true with the Alberto Knot, Crazy Alberto Knot, Slim Beauty and the Uni to Uni Knot. It is not the knots diameter that binds at the tip, it’s the length of the knot. If the knot length equals or exceeds the inside diameter of the guide, it won’t make the turn. Perhaps Trey can replace the micro tip guide with a standard tip guide. I have never experienced a problem passing knots through a standard (#6 I think) guide. The second negative is that you won’t want to fish your other rods. This can have an impact on your pocketbook and what do you do with all your other rods that fail in comparison. I can hide them from the wife, but somehow she finds them, I could call them my “arsenal”, but even I don’t buy that one, I have grandsons, perhaps that will work. Many Thanx to Trey, and the staff at Kistler Custom Rods.<\/p><p><strong>Ed Anderson<\/strong><\/p><p>Hi, my name is Ray Long and I am an addict. (lol). But seriously, I am totally addicted to the new Kistler Z Bone. The lightest and most sensitive rod that I have ever picked up. I can't even imagine ever fishing with another rod and to think about all the fish that I have missed over the past 20 years or so. But I guarantee there will not be any missed bites now - truly amazing - if a fish even breathes on your lure, you will feel it. All fishermen and fisherwomen should try a z bone once and you will be joining the rest of us in the z bone Anonymous meetings.<\/p><p><strong>Ray Long<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Z Bone<\/strong><\/p><p>Precision pitching, flipping, casting and sensitivity are what you can expect from a Kistler Z-Bone. I own 3 and wont buy any other rod from now on! As a man that once was a faithfull, nothing but, G-Loomis user, I have converted to a Kistler Z-Bone guy. Z-Bones have payed for themselves twice this year alone. Thanks to all at Kistler Rods for the most innovative rod on the market. They really give a guy the edge on todays highly pressured lakes.<\/p><p><strong>Jason White, Engineer, Bucyrus, Kansas<\/strong><\/p><p>I'm an admitted part time baitcast user (I've preferred spinning tackle for 30 years). I just spent 8 hours fishing on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire with the Kistler Micro Magnesium McMag70MC with a Daiwa TD Zillion Left Hand - 6.3:1 and a BassPro Laser Eye 3\/8 oz Chartreuse\/White Chartreuse\/White Gold\/Nickel Blades. and Sufix 14 lb Tritanium Plus Copolymer line. Ok the short story. I was able to zing the spinnerbait out about 75' to 100' and when 20 smallmouth and the lone 28\" chain pickerel attacked, the reel drag was a smooth as silk. The rod handled the up to 4 pound smallmouth like a champ. I was able to leverage the cast by using the rear boss on the butt end of the rod as a fulcrum and casting was pretty effortless. The reel felt natural to my hand on this rod. I could leave my hand in the as cast postion or move it up to cup the reel and it felt good in either position. I had no problem applying pressure on the fish either right or left using the leverage of the rod butt against my forearm. With 5' of line out I was able to lift the fish into the boat with no problem. Overall the whole rig just felt well balanced and with the reel adjusted for the weight of the bait, I could cast all day long. This rod was simply great with a spinnerbait.<\/p><p><strong>Dennis Boulais, Design Engineer, Connecticut<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Micro Magnesium McMag70MC<\/strong><\/p><p>My wife and I own 25 Kistler rods and we won't own anything else.

Just got off KY lake after fising for 8 hrs and not even tired! My wife used to only be able to fish for an hour or so before tiring with other rods. Now that she has as many Kistler rods as I do, she fishes all day with me. If I buy a new rod , she has to have one too! I challenge anyone who bass fishes to try a Kistler rod and I guarantee, you will, throw your other rods overboard!!! Thanks KISTLER for making the best and most sensitive rod ever!!!!!!<\/p><p><strong>Steve Perkins<\/strong><\/p><p>It's been a while since I posted anything but after fishing with the new Z-Bone rods I couldn't hold out any longer. I have been fishing with Kistler rods since the very beginning and have owned at least 35 different models ranging from the California series, Mark Tyler series, Helium LTA's, Helium LTX's, Magnesium, Argon, Micro Magnesium and finally Z-Bone. The bottom line is this...Kistler rods will make you a better fisherman. I know, you here stuff like this all the time but I'm telling you the truth. I have no reason to lie and many trophies and plaques to back it up. There are a lot of things that will make you a better fisherman...for example, great reels, great lures and great line. But what good is all that without a great rod. I took a friends advice about 10 years ago and gave a Kistler rod a try. Things have never been the same since. The sensitivity and feel of a Kistler rod is like no other. Since that time I have never even considered trying anything else. I believe this, if you have something you have confidence in...you better use it. Maybe this will help someone that is straddling the fence and can't decide what to do. Go buy you a Kistler rod and see if I'm not telling the truth. You will be just like I was, telling my friend how much I appreciated what he did.<\/p><p><strong>Billy Richards<\/strong><\/p><p>I have been fishing kistler rods for the past 2 years.

At first my friends were skeptical about how well these guides actually prevent braid from wrapping around the guides. Then one of them wrapped the braid around the tip about 5 times and it came loose with ease. Needless to say they were all astonished. The blank itself is pretty much the perfect blank for flipping with braid. The tip is light enough to make the most quiet of presentations accurately, yet there's still plenty of backbone to wrestle fish out of heavy cover. On top of that, it's hands down the most sensitive rod ever built. Don't know if it's just the blank or the micro guides or combination but this combo is the way to go. I took it out for a little test run on Lake Toho the first day and was fortunate enough to catch 3 fish over 8 pounds with my new Z Bone. Talk about breaking it in. Anyway, the parabolic bend actually fights the fish for you. It's an experience that I've not had with any other flippin stick. The only complaint I have is that I don't have enough money to replace all my rods with the Z Bone LE and Micro K guides.<\/p><p><strong>Hojin<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Z Bone LE<\/strong><\/p><p>I finally got to use my new custom built z bone rod this past Saturday and amazing is all I can say. When people say that the rod has nothing to do with catching more fish, then I say they are wrong. This rod is so sensitive that I felt every little thing that my lure touched, it was Unbelievable and I caught every fish that bit. Example - I was catching 3 times as many fish as my partner was and we where using the same lure and same line weight. After about 3 hours we switched rods and he started catching 3 times as many fish as I was. He could not believe it until we switched and now he is hooked (almost didn't get my rod back). SO, if you want to feel and catch more fish then I suggest you go out and buy you a Kistler rod - especially the new \"Z BONE\".

My main purpose was for T-rigs and Senkos and this rod delivers. I own a lot of high end rods and consider the Z-Bone to be among the best if not the best. The thing I am most impressed with is the lightness, balance and sensitivity. It is one of the most sensitive rods I have ever used and have been feeling bites I may have missed otherwise.

Keep up the great work guys!<\/p><p><strong>Steve Wall<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Z-Bone<\/strong><\/p><p>Within the past month I got three zbone LE's and two Micro magnesium rods. As a loyal Kistler customer, I was very anxious to see how the micro guides were going to perform. I got two Zbone 7' Heavy LE's one 7mh Z bone le, one 7' heavy MicroMag and one 6'10 medium heave spinning rod. The Zbones are the most sensitive rods that I have ever used, and I have had GLX's Legend Elites, etc. The overall sensitivity and strength of the zbones raised the bar to a whole new level. The microguides are absolutley sensational. I was weary to try them in the beginning, but once i got them and used them they lived up to the speculation. Casting distance is far greater because there is less resistance with the guides. Also they are very easy to get in and out of the rod locker which is a bonus. They are lighter, stronger, and more durable than regular sized guides, and made by Fuji you cannot go wrong. On the spinning rod, it eliminates line twist while increasing the distance. For years anglers were trying to figure out how to put spinning rods in their rodlocker and not take up an over abundance of room. Microguides solve the issue. Lastly, I would like to talk about the micromagnesium's. They are the best rod that you can get in that price range period. The sensitivity of the rod is comparable to that of a 250 dollar rod, and they are well balanced. For years Kistler has been leading in terms of technological advancements on rods, and Trey and his staff have done it again with Microguides and bringing them in at a reasonable price on their most selling rod. If you are going to get a zbone or a magnesium and are unsure about the microguides just get them because they are worth the extra money and just phenominal once you start using them.<\/p><p><strong>Corbin Gotwalt, Zbone and Micro Magnesium\/Micro guides<\/strong><\/p><p>Just wanted to let you fishermen out there know how great these Kistler rods are. I have been using these rods for about 7 years now and have no regrets (well maybe one, should have started using them long ago). I took my new z bone out fishing last weekend and I absolutly wrecked me some pigs. First of all, the crankbait bite was on and I was using my Argon crankbait rod with a shallow running crankbait tied on and it was just about every 5th cast. I wanted to change over to my rattletrap but I didn't want to take the crankbait off the Argon so I picked up my new z bone, tied the trap on it, and made the cast. I was shocked to see how far that trap went (thought for a minute that I unspooled my reel). Not only was I able to cast out twice as far, I was able to keep the trap in the strike zone twice as long, and let me tell ya, my arm was killing me by the end of the day from setting the hook (but oh what a great hurt). My new z bone with the new Fugi Micro Guides has got to be the greatest rod that I have ever owned. Just about all \"line slapping\" was elliminated with the new micro guides giving me the power to make those extra long cast. So, if any of you would like to catch more fish and feel every bite, then you have got to get one of these new Kistler z bone rods with the micro guides. Stay safe and God bless, Ray Long - South Alabama<\/p><p><strong>Ray Long<\/strong><\/p><p>\"Wow\" is the only word that I can use to describe my new Kistler Z-bone with Fuji Micro guide technology. Casting 3\/8 oz wooden crankbaits into the wind is no longer a chore. The sensitivity of the rod really helps me feel every rock and piece of wood that my crankbait comes in contact with. This is a key factor in triggering strikes. I Couldn't be happier with my Z-bone.<\/p><p><strong>Sean Wilkes, New York<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>Kistler Z-bone with Fuji Micro Guides<\/strong><\/p><p>Over the past couple years I've had a horrible issue with line failure on AS rods in that crucial 2-5 second period after hook-set (cost me lots of $.)

Please excuse my english, it's not as good as it used to be... However this post is a must! Last saturday I got back from a fishing trip to Calderon lake in central Mexico. I visit the lake at least four or five times every year, because I've seen reallly large bass and previoulsly landed there a 10-pounder (not from a kayak). So, yesterday was my dream day. I looked for a dropoff adjacent to deeper water, because I knew there would be big bass moving up to start spawning. I chose a good spot and concentrated on fishing the area with big fish lures (swimbaits, large senkos and big jigs). At around 2:30 PM, I felt a very subtle difference in the weight of the lure (I was fishing a 7-in wacky-rigged watermelon red stick bait), and immediately set the hook. I was rewarded with a huge response and the bass started to strip the line right away. I always check my drag to be smooth and not so tight so I was sure this was a big fish! I started to work the bass very carefully, and after a few minutes I could see the bass some 10 yards away from me, just breaking the surface. I plunged the rod in the water to prevent the bass from jumping and shaking the hook off, and net in hand, I worked the bass all the way to the kayak, not before several runs and carefully working the fish... The sensitivity of my rod was what allowed me to detect that very subtle pickup (Kistler Helium LTA He70HC), using 15-lb fluorocarbon line. The bass was a healthy big female, and weighted at the scales 14 pounds and 10 ounces!!!! That'a a whooping 6.8 kilograms!!! My record was 5.3 kilograms (around 11 pounds) so I am very very happy. Fortunately, a boat was close so I asked them to help me to take pictures and release the bass. Everything is also recorded on video. Back home I started to look into the figures of kayak-caught largemouth bass, and it is likely that this will be the next world record for largemouth bass from a kayak! (the actual record was caught in Florida, a 13-pounder)... I am still shaking! The fight was very strange; I had caught two double-digit bass before, but they both felt like pulling a sack of sand and only close to the boat they would run. This one felt more like a sailfish, running and stripping line from the moment the hook was set! Only now I really appreciate how important invest ing in good equipment is, I can't really say enough about my Kistler LTA, it is just superb, also the blank kind of \"loaded up\" to sustain the fight... and quite strangely I was enjoying every moment of the fight, perhaps because it was a looong fight, I played with the drag so I wouldn't break the line so I really enjoyed that huge fish! And more important, she is still there, perhaps in the future someone else will catch it again and hopefully release it! Now i can only dream of about the Z-Bone... maybe one day I'll have the chance of fishing with one! By the way this technique has produced some nice fish, dead-sticking a 7-in wacky-rigged senko in rocky bottoms, and a twitch every now and then... you got to have patience but it has payed off! in clear water I use watermelon seed, in stained water I choose watermelon red, and for murky or deep water black blue flake... these three colors are what have worked for me. I have improved my fishing techniques a lot using Kistler rods, I won 2nd place in the Central Mexican Qualifier (a total of 70 teams showed up) and a couple of months before won 4th place in a Kistler-sponsored event (I took home a Magnesium rod)...

I dare say any other rod I have would not have survived. I have used it twice since with no problems. You should have a real hit with these. As a side note I had several of my old Kistler rods re-fitted with the new micro guides . I now have 6 Kistler rods with micro guides. Here's something you may not have thought about--if you are like me and carry too many rods but can't stand to leave any at home.

No one but me fishes with my Kistler heliums!!! Simply the best rods EVER! Thanks guys for producing the finest sticks I've fished ..... the end!<\/p><p><strong>Darin Clum<\/strong><\/p><p>I recently made the switch to the Heavy 7'6\" Helium LTA for my general flippin & pitchin and it makes my other flippin sticks useless cause I don't ever want to touch them anymore. I've got it rigged with a Shimano Chronarch D & 65 lb Sufix braid and it's the perfect setup. The tip on this rod is just limber enough to make a quiet pitchin presentation and the bulged marbled cork handle aids in the pendulum action you're looking for. The handle's also the most comfortable and slip resistant I've tried. One of the downsides of braid is that it makes your rod less sensitive with a limp line, but you still feel everything with this rod. I mean you can breath on it and you feel it. It really comes in to play on those cold front days when the fish just barely grab it and don't move an inch. I've tried a bunch of flippin sticks and the Helium LTA is by far the best I've ever owned. The only improvement I could possibly make is adding the micro K guides to keep the braid from wrapping around the eye. I'm getting rid of all the others and will have multiple Kistler flippin sticks from here on out. This rod will ruin ya.<\/p><p><strong>Hojin, Orlando, FL<\/strong><\/p><p>S&H is excellent.

Before I bought my rod, I was told how superior the Z-Bone would be over other rods. Being a G-Loomis GLX owner, I was a little skeptical. But after five minutes of being out in the water with it, my expectations were far exceeded. Not really fishing, but just feeling the contour of the lake--the underwater structure, the gravel, the rocks, the weeds--the rod was so much more sensitive than I could have ever imagined. I can’t wait to actually take it out and fish tournaments with it. Trey has sold me on the new Z-Bone.<\/p><p><strong>Paul LeSaulnier, Kistler Fan for Life, Waterloo, IL<\/strong><\/p><p>I would like to thank Trey for talking me into taking a New Micro Mag to Falcon this last week.

I presently own 5 G Loomis and 4 ST Croix rods and have been very happy with them. Recently I was looking for a new Senko rod and came across the KISTLER MAGNESIUM TS CASTING ROD MGSWMH70 on sale at Cabels. Although it is manufactured in China I took a chance and ordered it. On the day it arrived I put a Abu-Garcia Revo ST on it and went Bass fishing that evening. Since I live in a private lake community (Lake Mohwak NJ) there is a catch and release policy therefore the fishing is excellent. We have three lakes that range in size form small to the largest man made lake in NJ. That night I put the KISTLER MAGNESIUM TS CASTING ROD MGSWMH70 to the test on one of the small lakes and caught 4 large mouth bass ( 1-3 lbs) in 2 hours. I was so impressed with the rod that I went to the Kistler web site and did some research on their products and was surprised to find some of there rods are made in the USA. After reading a few testimonials I purchased a He69MHC 2009 Helium LTA 6'9\" Medium-Heavy Fishing Rod from the website. Since I am going on vacation starting this saturday I ordered RUSH 2 day delivery. However, the rod did not ship the day I ordered it so I immediately called their customer service and spoke with Cindy. About an hour later I received an email with a tracking number and tge rod will be here Friday so I can take it on vacation. I always felt customer service was dead in America but Cindy and Kistler proved me wrong. I am very fortunate to be employed in this terrible economy and able to purchase new fishing gear. Kistler, I hope you read this because you have a new fan. Thanks for making excellent rods in the USA, abroad, and excellent customer service. Thanks and look for my future orders in the near future and I replace my G Loomis and St Croix with Kistler rods.

Thank you for the great rods.<\/p><p><strong>Toby Gifford, Bassin Freak, New York<\/strong><\/p><p>My first experience with Kistler was in 2005, just before the Weekend Warrior champioship on Eagle Mountain Lake in Texas. During that 2005 season, I met a local pro-staffer and bought one of his \"experienced\" jig sticks after a local tournament...and man was I impressed. The feel, the sensitivity, and the look...it was the total package. I soon purchased a few more from the factory and before long I was culling my mix of rods for the newer and better, Kislters. While I worked hard and improved my tournament results I had yet to get a taste of the winners circle. But in the summer of 2005, I got my first tournament win with a Kistler in one and big fish of the tourney in the other!! We bested the 84 boat field that night and I was forever a Kistler owner.... Fast forward a few seasons and my quiver was Kistler laden and my tournament finishes were consistently in the top of the field. And in 2007, my team partner and I recorded 6 top 10 finishes and finished the season winning Angler of The Year for the 07' season. While many people believe rods are just rods, I do not. I firmly believe my Kistler Rods put me in the position to succeed everytime I enter a tournament. Even for the guys that fish when nothing is on the line, KistlerCustomRods is the way to go.

A few years ago I finally broke down and bought a Graphite Plus Series rod. I was so pleased with the sensitivity and the no foregrip design that I bought another one. Eventually I got the courage to try a Helium LTA rod and it lead to buying more. Now I have the two original Graphite Plus rods, one Magnesium TS, six Helium LTA's, two Helium 2 LTX's for a total of 12 Kistler rods. I absolutely believe that the sensitivity and light weight of the Kistler rods allows me to catch more fish and fish longer with less fatigue. I loan my rods to friends fishing in my boat and I always laugh at them when they are setting the hook on weeds or other objects in the water that they couldn't feel with their own rods. In a few hours of fishing I make believers out of them too. Over the past few years, I have had two rods break within days of buying them and they were replaced promptly by Kistler.

A lot of these tournaments were in the wind and conditions were tough to even fish let alone feel a bite. Im finding these situations to be my advantage when I got a Kistler in my hand.

In my modest opinion in having used many brands, there is no other rod that has the sensitivity and strength of a Kistler. As part of the Mexican Pro Circuit and fishing on some of the best Bass Fishing lakes in the world, it demands only the best tackle and equipment. Kistler has helped me win several tournaments and has helped improve my overall fishing. In Mexico I only use rods over 7' in order to get the hawgs turned around and away from all that nasty cover. In the past this meant heavy rods that broke your back, but thanks to the Helium and Magnesium series, I can fish a 2-day tournament and still have energy to pull in those Mexican monsters.

I recently had the privilege of fishing for Walleye on Lake Sasseginega, one of Canada’s Northern lakes. The trip presented my first opportunity to use my new Kistler Helium 2 LTX 7’ casting medium action rod paired up with a Zebco Omega 2 spincast reel loaded up with Red PowerPro 20lb line. The combo was fantastic as it allowed me to work my jig over the countless submerged tree branches left behind by the Beavers without once wrapping the jig around a branch. After I got home I wanted to test just how sensitive my helium 2 really was. I placed one of my Braille books open on the floor, and by running the Helium 2’s tip over the page I could actually feel the raised dots.

I am a \"touch and technique\" guy, you know plastics, jigs, etc. so feel is paramount to my style. However many of the rods with \"touch\" don't have the power to fight something large, so you are forced to \"dance\" around your boat or shore to land it. On the other hand the rods with power sometimes have the characteristics of a broom handle. The Kistler has been nothing short of amazing. Not only does it have exceptional feel, but it has the backbone to control your fish, not to mention it is ergonomically perfect, its about the only baitcaster, that I dont have to adjust my body or grip to it, I dont even think about the rod in my hand, the handle length and reel seat position are perfectly balanced and spaced. Great rod!<\/p><p><strong>Virgil Pattarino, Safety Coordinator<\/strong><\/p><p>I just want to write a quick note about a recent event. I took one of my fellow team members out on a lake in Phoenix, Arizona in February. He was fishing with a higher end rod\/reel (not a Kistler) and he accidentally dropped his rig in the water. OF course it sunk and my response to him was \"you should have been fishing a Kistler, they float\". Well the truth is I had never dropped one of my Kistlers into the water until 2 weeks ago. Even with all my rigging it floated and was rapidly retrieved. Now let me tell you my team member, the only way he got his rig back was to fish for it with a crank bait and it took 40 minutes.

In 1983, I co-founded AllStar Rods and in 1990 I founded Castaway rods and from 1983 until 12\/14\/98, I built the best rod that I could with the finest components available. My son, Trey, worked in both companies with me and believed then and now in customer service and quality..

Sure, I am his father(earthly) but there is one promise I can safely make; If you try his product, you will improve your fishing abilities.The proof is in the fact that there are very good and prominent fishermen using his rod successfully because of the uncomprimising committment to excellence.

I have been fishing since my very first summer here almost 20 years ago. In the last 3 years I have gotten very serious into tournament bass fishing and I have always been someone who demands the best equipment I can possibly afford. I have used All Star, Daiwa, Falcon, Fenwick, Shimano, St. Croix, and just about every brand of rod. I had rods that I thought were so sensitive and light and responsive...until the first time I picked up a Kistler. Out of all the top-of-the-line lures, line, plastics, jigs, rods, and reels that I have used over the years, none of them have changed my fishing anywhere near as much as Kistler rods have. They enable me to detect subtle bites that I would've never even known happened before. I fish a lot of ultra-clear, deep lakes with lighter line and it takes a very sensitive rod to detect some of these bites, without Kistler I am SURE I would not catch as many fish. When I read these testimonials before I got my first Kistler I thought most of them were a little over the top, or dramatic or maybe even people who worked for Kistler. Now I understand. These rods are SECOND to NONE. This is in NO way a commercial for Kistler. I am a bass angler that wants to help other bass anglers by clueing them into the BEST rods on the planet. Believe me, I've tried them all just about and nothing fishes like a Kistler. If you're debating what brand to try next, use this testimonial I am writing as the deal-closer.

We fished all morning throwing jerkbaits and Texas rigged worms as well as Carolina rigs. We caught around 25 bass to six pounds (all on various Kistler Baitcasting Rods) and never have used a lighter rod with so much backbone. At noon my guide suggested we try some golden shiners for St johns giant and an hour later a 9.5 lber (my personal best) was caught and released again using Kistler Rods. I was so impressed that I went out the next day and and purchased a KSRM7 for fishing in the ponds at Sawgrass near my home. Two days later (the first morning fishing with my new rod) a 10 lb bass was caught on a Senko! I truly have become a Kistler fan and will no doubt be buying many more Kistler products. Keep up the good work. Photos will gladly be sent on request. Thank You for a great product.<\/p><p><strong>Charlie Corring, Ponte Vedra, Florida<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>KSMR7<\/strong><\/p><p>Trey; Before I go any further I want to thank you for clearing up something for me. I have been hearing many of the Pros. referring to their rod and reels being an \"extension of themselves\". I have just thought they were selling fishing equipment because I have used so many rods over the years and never have I fished with any rod that came close to feeling like an extension of an appendage until the day I took my first LTA to the Lake. I now am trying to change all of my rods to Kistler. I also give credit to my 7' medium\/heavy LTX for a big part of catching the fish in the picture. I would not have felt the bite if not for that rod. The week before catching the fish in the picture, my Nephew and I were fishing an all-night tournament in one of the many what I refer to as extreme fisheries we have in our area. I believe I counted 18 great bass lakes within 1hr. 45 min. from my house including the California Delta. The lake we were fishing was Lake Don Pedro. Our lakes out here are smaller, deeper and clearer than the lakes the B.A.S.S. Elite series generally follow. I hooked one about 2:00 am and had her at the boat twice but had left the drag on my reel set too tight and she turned left and snapped my 14lb. Fluorocarbon like it was thread. She was a minimum of 3-4 lbs. larger than this one. The following week my Son-in-law and I went back to the same lake about a mile from where I was the week prior, using the same lure I found this little lady. What really makes this so cool to me is that there was a bite I had been missing. Maybe some of you that are pros. or just better fisherman than I am have felt this, I have always used good equipment G-Loomis etc. but there is a difference between good and great. To get back to where I was, this bite felt more like the fish was humming ever so slight with it in her mouth for a second then nothing then back to that very slight vibration. What does everyone say? Pulling is free! I pulled and she pulled back. It was an awesome day for me and I wish everyone could experience it. One last thing but it is the most important too me, I had her weighed by the park Rangers and the Marina and took her back to where I caught her and released her back. Our fishing used to be rough around here because everyone kept the fish they caught. Now most all-bass fishermen around here release their fish and we have, I think the best bass fishing there is anywhere. Please practice catch and release. They now make replicas that will last your lifetime and you can't tell the difference. Leave them so you can come back and catch their offspring. I am now saving for a LTX 7' 11\" Swim Bait rod. I am fishing with my 7' M\/H and it is not made for the heavy Swim Baits I am throwing. I have found that buying the right rod and reel for a specific fishing method makes it much easier to increase your catch ratio. I did not mean to make this sound like a Kistler commercial but changing to Kistler has increased MY catch ratio by a big margin.

He had some rods on the deck of the boat, some kistlers and some st. croixs, they bounced down the road for about 100 yards along with his gps unit. Everything that was on the deck of the boat broke in pieces, except for all the kistler rods that he had on the deck. Amazing rods, that is all that I can say. Thanks for making such a great rod.<\/p><p><strong>Dustin Dunn, Manager, Black Oak Sports, Mascot, TN<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>All Kistler Rods<\/strong><\/p><p>Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackoaksports.com\/\" title=\"author's website\">http:\/\/www.blackoaksports.com\/<\/a><\/p><p>This is my second testimonial in 2 weeks, just finished BASS Elite Series as a Co-angler at Kissimmee Chain in Florida. The fishing was all over the board. Fish were caught on just about every technique depending on the day and the weather. I finesse fished, wormed, cranked, through a chatter bait, a spinner bait, flipped and pitched. As a coangler you are limited to very few rods and I used my 7' MH Helium 2 LTX rods for all these purposes and cashed a check in the first two events I ever fished like this. They are strong, light and extremely sensative. I'm not sure I really need any other rods in my arsenal anymore. Thanx Kistler, couldn't have done it without you!<\/p><p><strong>Dr Kurt Michaux, LTX's for every need, Florida<\/strong><\/p><p>Just fished my first BASS Elite Series as a co-angler and used my brand new LTX 7' MH's and I made the cut and got a check.

They are so light weight, that after 3 days of fishing, I barely had any shoulder or wrist fatigue too........thanx Kistler, I'm ready to get a few more.

As with many who have said before me, I've used all of the rods out there and still use GLoomis (GL3\/GLX) and St. Croix (Legend\/Avid), till I called to get them to change something\/add Fuji Sic guides. To my astonishment that is when I was told they did not do that sort of custom work! Makes you wonder why they call themselves \"Custom\" rod builders. My first Helium LTA was a stock 7' Med action and I thought I had the perfect Rod till Clifford put together a custom built 7'6\" Helium LTA, He76MS and yes he wrapped it with my supplied Fuji Sic guides for Red fishing here in N.E.

I got it a season or two ago. It was a Helium LTX 2. It truly changed the way I fished. I never knew a rod could make that much difference, but it definitely does. I started using Kistler Rods in both my everyday fishing and during bass tournaments. I started catching more bass almost immediately. The quality of a Kistler is another thing that keeps me coming back. I gradually started replacing all my rods with Kistler Rods. We've even started using Kistler Rods with kids when we take them out during our Fishing Tree classes. The kids can really tell the difference in a rod also. When we teach them to fish with a Texas Rig for instance, the reactions they make when they feel that fish take the worm are priceless.

The customer service is first class, and I admire Trey for sharing his faith in God very openly on the labels that are attached to the rods when you receive them.

Well, to set the stage, I have been fishing for about 28 years now. Other than top water, fishing an ultra light combo is my next favorite way to catch largemouth bass here in Florida. (now the technique is called Finesse Fishing) I have used rods from many companies, but when I picked up a Kistler Rod, I was blown away. I have been switching all my rods to Kistler now. I bought a Magnesium Drop Shot Rod, it was the perfect ultra light rod for me. Light, extremely sensitive and now I know ultra strong. So I'm on Lake Harris using 6 lb. BPS flouro carbon on a drop shot rig in 15-20' of water with my new Kistler. I feel tap, tap and I set the hook. Wow! The fight was on. My drag started screaming. 15 minutes went by and I was sure this was the \"big one\". 30 minutes went by and I'm fighting and now starting to try to horse the fish in thinking this is not a bass but a cat fish. I had to chase the fish all over with my trolling motor to keep from getting spooled, but my rod is doubled over the entire time and is holding up. 45 minutes go by and now several boats have stopped to watch, but can't get her to the boat. At the hour mark, I'm now getting frustrated cause its stripping all my line off the reel, then I chase her, horse her toward the boat and as soon as she sees the boat, the fight starts again. 75 minutes and now I am holding the spool expecting my rod or line to break and literally forcing her to the surface. I'm done with the drag. I'm tired and need to get on with my pre-fishing. It was literally like pulling a small car off the bottom. Is it a catfish, a carp, maybe, just maybe the world record bass who didn't want to jump? I still have a slight hope in my mind. Nope, its an 8' foot Florida Alligator on 6 lb test and a Kistler Medium Light Rod. I know it sounds crazy, but it is completely true. Then of all things, she is sitting under me and I'm looking down to her and the hook gave way and it was over. Interestingly enough, she came up and sat right next to my boat as if she wanted to play some more tug of war, I guess no other rod ever gave her a good fight like that. I forfeited and went to another spot. Could you ever have a more magnificent testament to the strength of Kistler Rods? I don't think so. Oh, by the way, she is 1 of 2 gators I caught on a Med Lt Kistler rod. The other was on a shaky head in 6' of water with an LTA, same story, but she was only a 6 footer.<\/p><p><strong>Kurt, The one that didn't get away.....unfortunately!<\/strong><\/p><p>I've been using Kistler rods for about 4 years now and could not be happier. A few weeks ago someone must have thought they would like to feel some of that same happiness as they broke into my barn and decided to steal them. What a testiment to a great rod, when burglers break in, have the opportunity to steal thousands of dollars worth of stuff but took only my Kistlers, a life jacket and two shimano reels.

The performance has been fantastic and thay have helped me boat quite a few more fish. They seem to have a rod for everything if you do your homework. I fish a Senko a lot, and mostly fish it Wacky-style. That HE69APC with 14-16lb Flourocarbon is a deadly outfit for that bait, and also worls well for creature baits too. Last summer I won a two-day club tournament on Oneida Lake here in upstate NY using that rod with Senkos, and I never lost a single fish! The rod is flexible enough to throw the bait a long way with 16lb line , but has plenty of backbone to set the hook. Try it with an Abu Revo-the combination is perfect.). Also, the magnesium Flippin rod is an awesome rod for large tubes. We fish the large tubes for Smallmouth (Schubert) and that rod works great for that!

I was amazed at the sensetivity of that rod. I live out west and I am used to fishing deep water up to 75 feet. I have purchased four kistler rods since then and I can say that they are the most sensative and comfortable rods that I have fished with.To give you an example, I recently fished the b.a.s.s. federation club regional tournament at lake Amistad.On the last day I found that my shallow bite had died by 2pm. It was very windy and I needed two more fish for my limit. I went to a spot to drop shot.Because of the conditions,I needed a 3\/8 weight because I was fishing 60 feet deep.I used my magnesium ts 7ft. jig and toad special rod with 10lb. test. I was still able to feel the bite with that rod from 60ft.It is amazing that that big rod still had the sensativity for that condition.

If you don't have at least 12 rods with you when you go out, you are cheating yourself. I have also learned the advantage of using quality rods and reels vs. best price. This started with buying, Fenwick glass, the original Ugly Stick in 74\/75, the first Browing Boron, St Crouix Premier, Fenwick HMG, Daiwa, Shimano, G Loomis, Bass Pro Shop, Gander Mountain etc, etc,etc. Of all the rods I have used, in my opinion, the feel, sensitiv, castability, lightness and fish catching ability of both the Helium LTA and LTX are the finest I have used.

Not having to worry about rod failures makes my life whole lot easier.

Your brother, Bert Slane<\/p><p><strong>B Slane, ID<\/strong><\/p><p>My Kistler KTNT68 Tails and Topwater rod is by far the most versitile rod I've ever fished with. Wether you are battling big redfish in the marsh or hauling lunker bass from the lake this rod can do it all. Lightweight and strong this rod can walk the dog or bump a jig equally. If I could only have one rod this would be the one. I also own several Helium baitcaster and spincast rods. I'm often amazed at their lightweight strength and sensitivity. The fit, grip and balance of the Helium spincast rods are like shaking hands with an old friend. Once you put one of these rods in your hands someone will have to pry them away from you.<\/p><p><strong>Vincent Rinando Jr., Houston\/Galveston<\/strong><\/p><p>Products Purchased \/ Services Used: <strong>TailsNTopwater, Helium Baitcaters and SpinCast<\/strong><\/p><p>I have been fishing for a long time. Quality and durability are essential considerations anytime I make a purchase for my saltwater angling endeavors. Without the slightest reservation, I suggest anyone who wants quality and durability in a fishing rod, consider a Kistler. Kistler craftmanship is fantastic. My rod is sensitive enough to feel a lazy winter trout bite, yet strong enough to muscle the big bull reds to hand. I've fished 'em all, Loomis, St. Croix, Shimano, etc. and nothing compares to my Kistler.

A quick Call to the fine folks at Kistler, and an hour drive, I walked into their office, and was back on the road within 5 minutes with my rod replaced. I have been absolutely astonished at how sensitive these rods are. At times, I feel I could tell how many teeth the speckled trout at the other end of the line had.

These days, not many are willing or have the courage to stand on their Christian values and I applaud and support him for it. I believe Christians should support fellow Chritians. You won't go wrong with the right heart. However, make no mistake if the the rod was not as good as advertised I would not buy another one, because I am kind of cheap.

The bite was pretty good, so I had two rods rigged up. One was a 7' Heavy Kistler H2 LTX and the other was a 7' Heavy action \"other brand\" (still a very good rod). I couldn't believe what a difference that H2 made. When throwing 1oz. jigs all day long, the lighter your rod, the longer you can keep casting. It's still hard for me to believe how light the new rods are, while still keeping all the sensitivity and feel, and not to mention the hook hanger. Don't leave home without your Kistlers!!

But, after five months of using them. The lack of a fore grip was not a problem.<br\/>The 734mh became my favorite rod this season. I used it to launch Rapala DT10 and Dt14 crankbaits. I have a Lews ss15a reel mounted on it. This rod was such a joy to cast. I could send a balsa crankbait into a good wind almost straight out. I mean without much effort, cast after cast. Just a great rod. Hooks ups were effortless.<br\/>The 693 was used mostly with a jigworm. The sensitivity and power made it a go to rod. These are my third and fourth Kistler Rods.

I do own one other Kistler Rod and I love them both.<br\/><br\/>Thank you for making the greatest rod I have ever owned.\"<\/p><p><strong>- Scott S.<\/strong><\/p>","html_content":""}},"1586963929232":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":false,"title":"","content":"","html_content":"<div class=\"assurance-container\">\n  <div class=\"iconText\">\n<div class=\"icon\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/5_year_warranty_badge_kistler-08.svg?v=1586964142\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"textFlex\">\n<h3>WARRANTY<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>Backed by the Trey Kistler Warranty Promise for Five Years.

These rods are simply gorgeous and are truly feather light. At least the equal of my NRX rods, and when factoring in the customization, they are a fisherman’s dream come true. Nothing else compares! While the rods themselves are exquisite, the customer service is off the charts! Both Trey and Rueben have gone the extra mile by exceeding my previous experience in lofty customer service standards…especially when responding to customer enquires and reasonable adjustments to existing orders. Having a premiere rod producer coupled to such exemplary customer service is a one-two punch that blows away the competition. Be forewarned…once you go Kistler Z bone, you won’t be going back. I’m already eyeing a spinning rod in Lite Medium….just can’t get enough!

Been using the 7'3\" for chatterbaits and crankbaits. Best rod I've ever held in my hands for these techniques! The attention to detail on every Kistler rod is remarkable! - Paul Roecker<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amazing Rod&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br>\"Being a big fan of Trey Kistler and the rods his company makes, I had to try the new Feel n Reel rods when they hit the market. Once again, Kistler Rods doesn't disappoint. I use my Feel n Reel Rods, yes I bought a few of them, is any condition. My two favorite are cranking and throwing the A-Rig. The thing that has helped me land more fish is the smooth and easy hook set. It has the touch to \"feel\" the strike and hook set and the backbone to \"reel\" in the biggest hawgs.

The tip is forgiving when you hook up and also allows an angler to launch baits a mile. Two thumbs up!\" - Brad<\/p>\n<p><strong>APP (All&nbsp;Purpose 7'3\")&nbsp;Fits&nbsp;the&nbsp;Description&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br>\"I gave the rod a good workout the past few weekends. I was afraid it was going to be too heavy for medium crankbaits, but I was surprised I could cast 3XDs and flatsided cranks as good as it did. I didn't know how it would perform compared to my older FNRs. I switched one of the crankbaits for a bladed jig and tested that too. Even with 20-pound line (both lure applications, and yes I crank with heavy \"flouro\" in shallow, snag-prone areas) it performed very good and I caught some good fish on it.

A fly rod must do what it’s intended to do, but exceptional rods function with feeling. <b>They become an extension of the angler’s will and intention.<\/b> The Kistler Bakk Series Fly rods are the perfect introduction to the way fishing should feel. They are powerful yet sensitive, both assertive and responsive.<p><\/p> From tip to butt, the Bakk Series rods are a true do-it-all tool. These are true fishing tools- designed with the vision of creating a rod that can be equally at home (or comfortable) dropping a small dry fly to wild browns on an alpine creek as it is lobbing a heavy indicator rig into the wind for large lake-run trout.<p><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n  <div class=\"flex-item-right\" style=\"color: white; margin: 0px;\">Building on the foundation of a multi-modulus feather-light unsanded blank, every detail and component has been carefully chosen to work in concert to achieve the highest level of feel. <p><\/p>The nickel titanium single foot REC recoil guides with custom spacing work together with the custom shaped cork grip to provide the angler with the highest level of touch and casting accuracy. With top end components, a low swing weight and a feather-light feel in hand, these rods are a joy to cast, mend, and fight even the strongest of fish.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<style>\n.html-content--808a3bf6-62ff-4a04-9c9b-072826710e5f {\nbackground: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,.6),rgba(0,0,0,.6)),url('https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Fly_photos_Edited61.jpg?v=1669831121');\nbackground-size: cover;\nbackground-position: center;\n}\n\n\n@media only screen and (min-width: 800px) {\n.html-content--808a3bf6-62ff-4a04-9c9b-072826710e5f {\npadding: 60px 60px;\n\n}\n}\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: nowrap;\n}\n\n.flex-container > div {\n  background-color:;\n  width: 100%;\n  text-align: center;\npadding: 25px;\ntext-align: left;\n}\n\n\n\n@media (max-width: 800px) {\n  .flex-container {\n    flex-direction: column;\n  }\n}\n<\/style>"}},"c2b38d05-4c45-4a83-928f-8caffbe9159e":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":true,"title":"","content":"","html_content":"<div class=\"wideImg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Fly_new_new-01.jpg?v=1670530692\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"mobImg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Fly_new_new-11.jpg?v=1670530692\"><\/div>\n\n<style>\n@media only screen and (min-width: 800px) {\n.mobImg {\ndisplay: none;\n}\n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 800px) {\n.wideImg {\ndisplay:none;\n}\n}\n.html-content--c2b38d05-4c45-4a83-928f-8caffbe9159e {\npadding: 60px 0px 60px 0px;\n}\n<\/style>"}},"5585cc50-688b-403c-8f1a-eba49f78971c":{"type":"multicolumn","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#000000","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":true,"top_padding":false,"bottom_padding":false,"title":"","show_column_1":true,"title_1":"","content_1":"<p><\/p>","image_1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Fly_graphics_black-12.jpg","btn_text_1":"","btn_url_1":"","btn_style_1":"","show_column_2":true,"title_2":"","content_2":"<p><\/p>","image_2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Fly_graphics_black-13.jpg","btn_text_2":"","btn_url_2":"","btn_style_2":"","show_column_3":false,"title_3":"","content_3":"<p><\/p>","btn_text_3":"","btn_url_3":"","btn_style_3":"","show_column_4":false,"title_4":"","content_4":"<p><\/p>","btn_text_4":"","btn_url_4":"","btn_style_4":"","show_column_5":false,"title_5":"","content_5":"<p><\/p>","btn_text_5":"","btn_url_5":"","btn_style_5":""}},"0dc75f97-a576-4633-a8b0-f577e4a31f9e":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":true,"title":"","content":"<p><\/p>","html_content":"<div class=\"flex-container\">\n  <div class=\"flex-item-left\" style=\"margin: 0px;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Kistler-9781.jpg?v=1669831960\"><\/div>\n\n  <div class=\"flex-item-right\" style=\"margin: 0px;\">\n<h1 style=\"font-size: 100px;\">5 wt<\/h1>\n<p style=\"color: black;\">You need this rod if you fish in the typical places: small streams where fly placement is paramount as well as bigger water where you might need to bomb a cast to the opposite bank, throw multiple flies or even small streamers.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: black;\">Truly the jack-of-all-trades trout rod that is perfect for the beginning angler and even hold surprises for the expert who wants to unlock its full potential.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"btn btn--large\">Shop 5 wt<\/a>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<style>\n\n.html-content--0dc75f97-a576-4633-a8b0-f577e4a31f9e {\nbackground:linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,.6), rgba(255,255,255,.6),rgba(255,255,255,.6)), url('https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Fly_photos_Edited233.jpg?v=1669833083');\nbackground-size: cover;\nbackground-position: center;\n}\n\n.html-content--0dc75f97-a576-4633-a8b0-f577e4a31f9e h1 {\nfont-family: 'Molluska', 'GT America Compressed Bold' !important;\ntext-transform: lowercase;\nfont-weight: 500;\nmargin-bottom: 10px !important;\nline-height:1em;\n}\n.html-content--0dc75f97-a576-4633-a8b0-f577e4a31f9e {\n\n}\n\n\n@media only screen and (min-width: 800px) {\n.html-content--0dc75f97-a576-4633-a8b0-f577e4a31f9e {\npadding: 60px 60px;\n\n}\n}\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: nowrap;\n}\n\n.flex-container > div {\n  background-color:;\n  width: 100%;\n  text-align: center;\npadding: 25px;\ntext-align: left;\n}\n\n\n\n@media (max-width: 800px) {\n  .flex-container {\n    flex-direction: column;\n  }\n}\n<\/style>"}},"5d5fc435-b6eb-4b68-a371-871461a1ed15":{"type":"image-video-with-text","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":true,"top_padding":true,"bottom_padding":true,"text_align":"right","text_padding":true,"title":"5 wt Handle","description":"<p>Our custom shaped cork in a custom half wells style grip that accommodates all hand sizes.

A fly rod must do what it’s intended to do, but exceptional rods function with feeling. <b>They become an extension of the angler’s will and intention.<\/b> The Kistler Bakk Series Fly rods are the perfect introduction to the way fishing should feel. They are powerful yet sensitive, both assertive and responsive.<p><\/p> From tip to butt, the Bakk Series rods are a true do-it-all tool. These are true fishing tools- designed with the vision of creating a rod that can be equally at home (or comfortable) dropping a small dry fly to wild browns on an alpine creek as it is lobbing a heavy indicator rig into the wind for large lake-run trout.\n<\/div>\n\n  <div class=\"flex-item-right\" style=\"color: white; margin: 0px;\">Building on the foundation of a multi-modulus feather-light unsanded blank, every detail and component has been carefully chosen to work in concert to achieve the highest level of feel.<p><\/p>The nickel titanium single foot REC recoil guides with custom spacing work together with the custom shaped cork grip to provide the angler with the highest level of touch and casting accuracy. With top end components, a low swing weight and a feather-light feel in hand, these rods are a joy to cast, mend, and fight even the strongest of fish.  \n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<style>\n.html-content--4c33910e-3aa6-4baa-b40f-58fbaf34c9a8 {\nbackground: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,.6),rgba(0,0,0,.6)),url('https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Fly_photos_Edited61.jpg?v=1669831121');\nbackground-size: cover;\nbackground\n}\n\n\n@media only screen and (min-width: 800px) {\n.html-content--4c33910e-3aa6-4baa-b40f-58fbaf34c9a8 {\npadding: 60px 60px;\n\n}\n}\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: nowrap;\n}\n\n.flex-container > div {\n  background-color:;\n  width: 100%;\n  text-align: center;\npadding: 25px;\ntext-align: left;\n}\n\n\n\n@media (max-width: 800px) {\n  .flex-container {\n    flex-direction: column;\n  }\n}\n<\/style>"}},"4361d50b-eff4-4d6b-ac75-3ee7b4d0f2a2":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#1a1a1a","full_width":true,"title":"","content":"<p><\/p>","html_content":"<div class=\"wideImg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Fly_new_new-01.jpg?v=1670530692\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"mobImg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/0370\/0784\/files\/Fly_new_new-11.jpg?v=1670530692\"><\/div>\n\n<style>\n@media only screen and (min-width: 800px) {\n.mobImg {\ndisplay: none;\n}\n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 800px) {\n.wideImg {\ndisplay:none;\n}\n}\n.html-content--4361d50b-eff4-4d6b-ac75-3ee7b4d0f2a2{\npadding: 60px 0px 60px 0px;\n}\n<\/style>"}},"db8b16c0-6aaf-40eb-b590-4c4392f2102d":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#ffffff","text_color":"#ffffff","full_width":false,"title":"Built By Hand","content":"<p>Custom Rod Builders Since 1999.

Here at Kistler we wanted to take a different approach by offering the fabulously popular 2500 Sized Chromium Spinning Reel Models, in two different Gear Ratios. This approach allows technique-specific Users to gain more “Inches Per Turn (IPT)” without the need to purchase a larger heavier reel. <\/p><p>In our effort to deliver a Product Line fit for a King, Queen, and everything in between, we would like to introduce the CRSP-2561 as one of the most WATER RESISTANT and the CRSP-2572 as one of the fastest, most WATER RESISTANT Freshwater to Inshore Saltwater Cross-Over Spinning Reels to ever make its way to the Market. In many ways the CRSP-2572, and CRSP-2561, exemplify what most manufacturers have been unable or unwilling to supply…undeniable Substance over Style. <\/p><p>These durable and compact next generation Kistler Spinning Reels come to you in rare form and we continue to believe that we’ve packed as much performance, strength, durability, and support into the lightest, most cost-effective packages possible.<\/p><p>In the beginning, we focused on comparability, as in, “Is what we’re attempting to deliver, been delivered, or already being delivered?” We looked at a number of characteristics such as Performance, Durability, Size, Gear Ratio, Price, WATER RESISTANCE features, Bearing Count, Max Drag, Line Retrieval Rate, and Weight in products already being delivered by other Manufacturers. We found that in almost all cases we could land the SEALED Kistler Chromium CRSP-2572 and CRSP-2561 on almost all of the “Best Of” Lists with the exception of “Heaviest Duty” and “Lightest Weight”, of which weren’t a part of our primary goals to begin with. <\/p>","btn_text_1":"","btn_url_1":"","btn_style_1":"","show_column_2":true,"title_2":"WATER RESISTANCE","content_2":"<p>The SEALED Chromium Spinning Reels have been designed to be an excellent Freshwater to Inshore Saltwater, WATER RESISTANT Cross-Over, Left Hand\/Right Hand Capable Product Line. In many cases, when a consumer is looking to purchase a Spinning Reel, they are looking for three things, Price, Performance, and Durability. As we all know, to deliver long term Performance and Durability, it requires attention to be paid to many different aspects in the construction of a fishing reel. <\/p><p>To honestly deliver a Freshwater to Inshore Saltwater Capable Product Line, WATER RESISTANCE had to be a big part of the vision, so we utilized Closed Face Anodized Aluminum “Braid-Ready” Spools to limit water and debris access through the Rotors, strong Carbon Reinforced Nylon Frames to limit potential Corrosion and Rust Build-up, and strategically positioned additional POM Bushings to support the FULLY SEALED Main Drive Gear Saltwater Bearings with removable Side Shields to decrease distortion potential and increase Overall Rigidity, Hollow Stainless Steel Bail Wires to minimize weight, increase durability,reduce the need for a Weights to Counterbalance the Rotors, durable Titanium-Coated Hardened Brass Line Rollers to increase their performance, durability, heat resistance, and further limit Corrosion and Rust Build Up, 6 WATER RESISTANT SEALS, and 4 FULLY SEALED WATER RESISTANT Saltwater Bearings with removable Side Shields to SEAL up the Carbon Fiber Drag Stacks, Clutch Boxes, and Gear Boxes as much as possible.<\/p>","btn_text_2":"","btn_url_2":"","btn_style_2":"","show_column_3":false,"title_3":"","content_3":"","btn_text_3":"","btn_url_3":"","btn_style_3":"","show_column_4":false,"title_4":"","content_4":"","btn_text_4":"","btn_url_4":"","btn_style_4":"","show_column_5":false,"title_5":"","content_5":"","btn_text_5":"","btn_url_5":"","btn_style_5":""}},"158c6be5-2b9b-4da7-884c-bf604ab07af7":{"type":"multicolumn","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#252a2b","text_color":"#ffffff","full_width":true,"top_padding":true,"bottom_padding":true,"title":"TECHINICAL DETAILS","show_column_1":true,"title_1":"","content_1":"<p><strong>Weight<\/strong><br\/>In a world of “SEALED” Saltwater Capable Reels, you’ll find that our 8.8 oz Chromium Spinning Reel Product Line stands on its own merits when many of our actually SEALED competitors come in weighing equal to or more than the CRSP-2572 and CRSP-2561 and often times with fewer WATER RESISTANCE features.<\/p><p><strong>Gear Ratio\/Line Retrieval Rate<\/strong><br\/>While most of the industry standard traditionally tops out at 6.2:1 and below, you’ll find that our 7.2:1 Chromium CRSP-2572 allows for a faster Line Retrieval Rate, of 38” per turn, while the 6.1:1 Chromium CRSP-2561 has a Line Retrieval Rate of 32” per turn.<\/p><p><strong>Drag Knob Assembly<\/strong><br\/>We decided to increase the WATER RESISTANCE, strength and durability of our Drag Knob Assemblies by utilizing Brass Drag Nuts housed in Carbon Reinforced Nylon and Stainless Steel Housings, while simultaneously pairing them with Rubber 360 Degree Fitted SEALS. We did this to improve the WATER RESISTANCE of the Drag Stack Cavities, limit breakage, and increase the amount of applied tension possible.<\/p><p><strong>Spool Shaft<\/strong><br\/>We utilized Stainless Steel to ensure rigidity and long term durability, and to decrease the potential for pitting from corrosion and potential distortion. To further increase operational efficiency and stabilization we even made sure to support the Spool Shafts with rare dual-supported Oscillation Sliders, each with an additional 3x6x2 Micro Bearing for smoother performance.<\/p><p><strong>Drag Washer System<\/strong><br\/>We introduced rubber 360 Degree fitted SEALS between the Drag Knobs and the 3pc Floating Carbon Fiber Drag Stack Cavities with Stainless Steel Spacers, and an Audible Stainless Steel Drag Click System all to limit the potential for Drag System Failure, maintain Drag Consistency, and reduce potential failure due to Rust and Corrosion. <\/p><p><strong>Spool<\/strong><br\/>We chose to utilize Closed Faced “Braid Ready'' Anodized Aluminum Spools, with SEALS (as mentioned above) to protect the Carbon Fiber Drag Stack Cavities, by restricting access to damaging elements such as saltwater to increase corrosion resistance, therefore increasing the lifespan of the Carbon Fiber Drag Washers and Stainless Steel Spacers contained within. <\/p><p><strong>Braid Capacity <\/strong><br\/>for the CRSP-2572 and CRSP-2561 “Braid Ready” Spool are as follows: 10lb\/.15mm @130yds, 20lb\/.23mm @90yds, 30lb\/.28mm @80yds<\/p>","btn_text_1":"","btn_url_1":"","btn_style_1":"","show_column_2":true,"title_2":"","content_2":"<p><strong>Bail Wire<\/strong><br\/>We chose to utilize Graphite Rotor Brackets and Hollow Stainless Steel Bail Wires to increase the strength and durability of the entire automatic Bail Wire Trip System. By introducing these particular Bail Wires and Rotor Brackets we were able to maintain rigidity and balance the strong Carbon Reinforced Nylon Rotors without the necessity for additional counterbalance weighting system components commonly subjected to wear, tear, and potential failure.<\/p><p><strong>Line Roller Parts Group<\/strong><br\/>At first glance you might not notice, but we increased the strength and durability, for superior performance by introducing a Titanium-Coated, Hardened Brass Line Roller. The use of machined Aluminum is generally quite common across manufacturers, but are more susceptible to damage than the Hardened Brass of our Chromium Spinning Reel Product Line. What’s not so common is going the extra distance with a Titanium Coating to further harden and protect this part. By adding this Coating we further protect the long term smoothness, but we also increase the lifespan by increasing its resistance to wear, tear, heat, corrosion, and rust. We keep it all running smooth on a better protected, easily accessible 4x7x2.5 Stainless Steel Bearing. <\/p><p><strong>Pinion\/Rotor Retainer Nut<\/strong><br\/>To complement the durable, corrosion resistant, Brass Pinion Gears, we decided to pair them with Brass Rotor Retainer Nuts to maintain overall and synergistic Thread Strength, while increasing long term durability to maintain consistent fixed tension on the balanced Carbon Reinforced Nylon Rotors. To make sure they're all retained in a fixed position, we utilized Fixed Stainless Steel Rotor Nut Retainer Systems to increase strength and reduce the ability of the Rotor Nuts from working itself loose, which ultimately increases the lifespan of the entire Parts Group.<\/p><p><strong>Clutch Box<\/strong><br\/>Under the Carbon Reinforced Nylon Rotors we have done a lot to increase the durability and lifespan of the Clutch Boxes and their Internal Components. To begin with, we added Rubber Bearing Sleeves directly underneath the Rotors to aid our WATER RESISTANCE features such as the FULLY SEALED Stainless Steel 7x14x4 Saltwater Bearing with removable Side Shields that they house and protect. Below that you will find an “Anti-Reverse Only” 17x12 Roller Bearing Clutch and Sleeve System (ARO). By eliminating the generally useless Anti-Reverse Switch Systems we continue to reduce access to damaging elements and the amount of Components that are subject to common wear, tear, and potential failure. Directly below the ARO Clutch Systems, you will find another FULLY SEALED Stainless Steel 7x14x4 Saltwater Bearing with removable Side Shields to even further restrict access to damaging elements such as saltwater and aid in the stabilization of the Pinion Gear. Because the Clutch Boxes technically can allow access to the Gear Boxes, it becomes necessary to SEAL them up as much as possible to limit damaging elements from making their way through.<\/p><p><strong>Frame\/Gear Box<\/strong><br\/>To begin, I’d like to take a moment to recognize just the amount of WATER RESISTANCE features we have built into this Spinning Reel Product Line to SEAL the Gear Boxes as much as possible. By going this extra distance we create a longer lasting reel for Kistler Chromium Owners.<\/p><p><strong>Handle Assembly<\/strong><br\/>Finally we decided to power the whole Spinning Reel Product Line with Gear-Direct Connected Woven Carbon Fiber Cranking Handles, Aluminum Crank Spacers, and comfy yet durable EVA Handle Knob supported by 2 conveniently accessible Stainless Steel 4x7x2.5 Bearings to maintain performance.<\/p>","btn_text_2":"","btn_url_2":"","btn_style_2":"","show_column_3":false,"title_3":"","content_3":"","btn_text_3":"","btn_url_3":"","btn_style_3":"","show_column_4":false,"title_4":"","content_4":"","btn_text_4":"","btn_url_4":"","btn_style_4":"","show_column_5":false,"title_5":"","content_5":"","btn_text_5":"","btn_url_5":"","btn_style_5":""}},"1cb0aec5-fe94-4574-9ecf-2c86be0f2ab3":{"type":"html-content","settings":{"bkgd_color":"#252a2b","text_color":"#ffffff","full_width":false,"title":"Reel

For me, it’s important that the gear I’m using disappears and lets me feel the joy of angling - that act of trying to deceive a predator with something artificial.  These Hunt Series BFS rods feel like an extension of my arm and transmit what the lure is doing better than anything I’ve ever used.<\/p><p>I was also becoming aware that with more anglers are hitting the water, the fish are becoming more pressured as well.  It was becoming harder to find those big fish, because they are seeing more presentations.  Like the old saying goes: “Big fish don't get big by being stupid.”<\/p><p>This is what Bait Finesse was designed for:  For targeting those fish that have pretty much seen it all.  In my first full year of exclusively using BFS gear, I landed twelve personal bests.   This is why I jokingly say that “BFS” stands for “Big Fish System.”<\/p><p>When you’re fishing finesse techniques, sensitivity is important.  Now imagine throwing 1\/32 ounce lures and being able to feel when a fish picks it up even on slack line. Or knowing the difference between a rock and a moss-covered rock.  That’s the level of sensitivity I get with these rods.  I’ve even thrown 0.75 gram trout flies on the 4XUL!<\/p>","btn_text_1":"","btn_url_1":"","btn_style_1":"","show_column_2":true,"title_2":"","content_2":"<p><br\/>But a quality Bait Finesse rod is more than just casting light lures and being sensitive.  While these rods will make catching smaller fish a blast, for many of us the goal is bigger fish.  A quality Bait Finesse rod must have the backbone to land the bigs.  And that is probably the most surprising part of these rods.  As a large fish puts a deep parabolic bend into the blank, it becomes progressively stronger while maintaining the ability to act as a shock absorber for light line.<\/p><p>This is also why the Hunt BFS series is longer than many bait finesse offerings on the market.  That longer rod length gives you the advantage of leverage against powerful fish -

Note From Trey Kistler","show_column_1":true,"html_content_1":"<p>I have hand selected the most trusted fishing rod component manufacturers that I believe produce the best performing, longest lasting and highest quality parts available and have paired these with the strongest, most sensitive, American made 100% carbon fiber blanks I have ever helped design. <\/p><p>\nMy new KC10 blanks provide the highest level of sensitivity to strength ratio ever offered in one of my  Kistler Rod designs partly because of the uniquely woven Nitranium carbon fiber wraps embedded within each blank. <\/p><p>\nMy 30 years of experience in building fishing rods has influenced me to choose only the best of the best when it comes to a quality, proven, reliable, durable, light weight and smooth guide ring and tip top. My decision to employ the Fuji Silicon Carbide slim ringed guide and tip top with the corrosion coated stainless steel frames in the areas where the rod gets the most abuse, wear and tear. Combine this with the most well known Recoil guides that are ringless, flexible frames made from a titanium-nitrate “Nitranium” material, this noticeably lighter weight guide train will perform without any problems for life. <\/p>\n<p>I designed the custom inlayed, Portuguese full-length cork handles to maximize the anglers’ grip and comfort by using my specially developed rubber marbled cork…something out Kistler Z bone rod owners have come to love and request over the past decade.<\/p>","show_column_2":true,"html_content_2":"<p>\nI have been developing one rod model at a time by putting in hours of designing and field testing until I perfect each model with my customer in mind. There will eventually be a full line of Nitranium rod models uniquely crafted to perform under any situation or application once I complete my extensive research and development and testing one rod at a time. Soon, you could be the proud owner of a full set of beautifully American crafted rods with actions and powers that simply make you a better fisherman and truly enhances your fishing overall experience. <\/p><p>\nI have been credited and known for changing the face of the fishing rod over the past 25 years ‘the split grip handle and zero fore grip was introduced by me in 2004’…now I am offering a time tested, well thought out, comfortable, reliable, balanced, and crazy sensitive fishing rod that will flat out impress even the toughest critics around the world.<\/p><p>\nI guarantee your satisfaction in my latest and greatest creation with an industry leading “10 Year - Bend Strong” Limited Warranty.

So he set himself to the task of making the best bass fishing rod out there. We, and Trey, wouldn’t have it any other way. If his family name is going to be on it, it’s going to be the best.
